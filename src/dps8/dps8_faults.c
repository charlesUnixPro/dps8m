 FAULT RECOGNITION
 For the discussion following, the term "function" is defined as a major processor functional cycle. Examples are: APPEND CYCLE, CA CYCLE, INSTRUCTION FETCH CYCLE, OPERAND STORE CYCLE, DIVIDE EXECUTION CYCLE. Some of these cycles are discussed in various sections of this manual.
 Faults in groups 1 and 2 cause the processor to abort all functions immediately by entering a FAULT CYCLE.
 Faults in group 3 cause the processor to "close out" current functions without taking any irrevocable action (such as setting PTW.U in an APPEND CYCLE or modifying an indirect word in a CA CYCLE), then to discard any pending functions (such as an APPEND CYCLE needed during a CA CYCLE), and to enter a FAULT CYCLE.
 Faults in group 4 cause the processor to suspend overlapped operation, to complete current and pending functions for the current instruction, and then to enter a FAULT CYCLE.
 Faults in groups 5 or 6 are normally detected during virtual address formation and instruction decode. These faults cause the processor to suspend overlapped operation, to complete the current and pending instructions, and to enter a FAULT CYCLE. If a fault in a higher priority group is generated by the execution of the current or pending instructions, that higher priority fault will take precedence and the group 5 or 6 fault will be lost. If a group 5 or 6 fault is detected during execution of the current instruction (e.g., an access violation, out of segment bounds, fault
 ￼￼
 during certain interruptible EIS instructions), the instruction is considered "complete" upon detection of the fault.
 Faults in group 7 are held and processed (with interrupts) at the completion of the current instruction pair. Group 7 faults are inhibitable by setting bit 28 of the instruction word.
 Faults in groups 3 through 6 must wait for the system controller to acknowledge the last access request before entering the FAULT CYCLE.

 Faults in groups 1 and 2 cause the processor to abort all functions immediately by entering a FAULT CYCLE.
 
 Faults in group 3 cause the processor to "close out" current functions without taking any irrevocable action (such as setting PTW.U in an APPEND CYCLE or modifying an indirect word in a CA CYCLE), then to discard any pending functions (such as an APPEND CYCLE needed during a CA CYCLE), and to enter a FAULT CYCLE.
 
 Faults in group 4 cause the processor to suspend overlapped operation, to complete current and pending functions for the current instruction, and then to enter a FAULT CYCLE.
 
 Faults in groups 5 or 6 are normally detected during virtual address formation and instruction decode. These faults cause the processor to suspend overlapped operation, to complete the current and pending instructions, and to enter a FAULT CYCLE. If a fault in a higher priority group is generated by the execution of the current or pending instructions, that higher priority fault will take precedence and the group 5 or 6 fault will be lost. If a group 5 or 6 fault is detected during execution of the current instruction (e.g., an access violation, out of segment bounds, fault during certain interruptible EIS instructions), the instruction is considered "complete" upon detection of the fault.
 
 Faults in group 7 are held and processed (with interrupts) at the completion of the current instruction pair.
 
 Group 7 faults are inhibitable by setting bit 28 of the instruction word.
 
 Faults in groups 3 through 6 must wait for the system controller to acknowledge the last access request before entering the FAULT CYCLE.
 

After much rumination here are my thoughts for fault processing .....

For now, at least, we must remember a few things:

1) We only have 1 cpu so we have few & limited async faults - shutdown, TRO, etc.
2) We have no overlapping instruction execution
3) Becuase of 2) we have no pending instructions
4) We have no system controller to wait for
 
 Group 1 & 2 faults can be processed immediately and then proceed to next instruction as long as no transfer prevents us from returing from the XED pair.
 
 Group 3 faults will probably also execute immediately since a G3 fault causes "the processor to "close out" current functions without taking any irrevocable action (such as setting PTW.U in an APPEND CYCLE or modifying an indirect word in a CA CYCLE), then to discard any pending functions (such as an APPEND CYCLE needed during a CA CYCLE), and to enter a FAULT CYCLE."
 
 Group 4 faults will probably also execute immediately since a G4 fault causes "the processor to suspend overlapped operation, to complete current and pending functions for the current instruction, and then to enter a FAULT CYCLE."

 Group 5 & 6 faults will probably also execute immediately because "if a group 5 or 6 fault is detected during execution of the current instruction (e.g., an access violation, out of segment bounds, fault during certain interruptible EIS instructions), the instruction is considered "complete" upon detection of the fault." However, remember "If a fault in a higher priority group is generated by the execution of the current or pending instructions, that higher priority fault will take precedence and the group 5 or 6 fault will be lost. If a group 5 or 6 fault is detected during execution of the current instruction (e.g., an access violation, out of segment bounds, fault during certain interruptible EIS instructions), the instruction is considered "complete" upon detection of the fault."

 during certain interruptible EIS instructions), the instruction is considered "complete" upon detection of the fault.

 For furter justification of immediate execution since "Faults in groups 3 through 6 must wait for the system controller to acknowledge the last access request before entering the FAULT CYCLE."
 
 Group 7 faults will be processed after next even instruction decode instruction decode, but before instruction execution. In this way we can actually use bit-28 tp inhibit interrupts
