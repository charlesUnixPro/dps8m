*
*     The CMPN instruction algebtaically compares two numbers and sets the
* zero, negative, and carry indicators to indicate the results of the
* comparison.  The five possible settings of the indicators and the inputs
* which cause the settings are shown below:
*
* ZR NG CR        INPUTS          INPUT
*                              COMBINATION
*                                NUMBER
*

*  0 0 1     neg,pos,[N1]<[N2]     1
*  0 0 1     pos,pos,[N1]<[N2]     2
*  1 0 1     neg,neg,[N1]=[N2]     3
*  1 0 1     pos,pos,[N1]=[N2]     4
*  0 1 1     neg,neg,[N1]<[N2]     5
*  0 1 1     pos,neg,[N1]<[N2]     6
*  0 1 0     pos,neg,[N1]>[N2]     7
*  0 1 0     pos,pos,[N1]>[N2]     8
*  0 0 0     neg,neg,[N1]>[N2]     9
*  0 0 0     neg,pos,[N1]>[N2]    10
*
*
* where neg,neg,[N1]<[N2] means that the 1st operand is negative,
* the second operand is negative, and the absolute value of the ist
* operand is less than the absolute value of the 2nd.
*
*
*     Each of the even numbered input combinations is tested with:
*
*  1).  both of the numbers 9-bit decimal and floating point,
*  2).  both of the numbers 9-bit decimal with leading sign,
*  3)   both of the numbers 9-bit decimal with trailing sign,
*  4).  where possible, both of the numbers 9-bit decimal and unsigned.
*
*
*     Each of the odd numbered input combinations is tested with:
*
*  1).  both of the numbers 4-bit decimal and floating point,
*  2).  both of the numbers 4-bit decimal with leading sign,
*  3).  both of the numbers 4-bit decimal with trailing sign,
*  4).  where possible, both of the numbers 4-bit decimal and unsigned.
