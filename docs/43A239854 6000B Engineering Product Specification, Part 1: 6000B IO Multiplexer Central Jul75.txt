1.0     GENERAL DESCRIPTION  

        The IOM Central controls access to storage for the various chan-
        nels of the IOM by providing appropriate services to the channels,
        one at a time.

        The IOM has eight generic types of channels:

           o  Data Channel
           o  Connect Channel
           o  Fault Channel
           o  Wraparound Channel
           o  Bootload Channel
           o  Snapshot Channel
           o  Scratchpad Access Channel
           o  Special Status Channel
   
        Each channel has assigned to it four (4) 36 bit mailbox words. The
        use of these words vary with the type of channel. The words are
        listed below in the order that they appear in a memory map (lowest
        address first) and the definitions appear later in the text.


            List Point Word (LPW)
            List Pointer Word Extension
            Status Control Word (SCW)
            Working Storage for Data Control Word (DCW)

        The data channels are "payload" channels; they are responsible for
        information transfer with all external peripheral devices and adapters.
        The other seven types of channels are "overhead" channels; they per-
        form specialized internal functions necessary for successful opera-
        tion of the IOM.

        The IOM Central includes a scratchpad storage to hold various 
        channel control words. The scratchpad is a high speed store
        accessible to the IOM Central and the scratchpad access channel.
        It is used to reduce the time required for performing various
        services to channels, by storing control words for from 16 to 32
        payload channels. The LPW, LPW extension and DCW (see paragraph
        3.2) for each channel will normally be stored in scratchpad
        memory, unless scratchpad is not provided for a particular group
        of channels (see paragraph 2.2.2).

        Following the introduction to the various functions, a descrip-
        tion of a typical operations is included at the beginning of
        Section 3.0.

1.1     DATA CHANNELS

        Each data channel controls the flow of instructions, data and status
        between the IOM Central and a peripheral (or special) control unit.
        A data channel can use either of two basic methods of data transfer;
        direct or indirect. When the direct method of data transfer is used,
        the data channel specifies the core location (address) for each stor-
        age access. When the indirect method of data transfer is used, the
        IOM Central relieves the data channel of the task of addressing at
        the price of additional accesses by the IOM to: (a) core, or (b)
        scratchpad storage. The indirect data channel must, however, spec-
        ify its channel number, which determines the location of its control
        words. Each time the indirect data channel makes an access request,
        the IOM Central obtains from core (or from the scratchpad) the ap-
        propriate control word, which defines the address for the data trans-
        fer and a tally specifying the amount of data to be transferred.

        Each type of interface to a peripheral (or specials) control unit
        requires a particular type of data channel, so that in general there
        are several types of data channels, each of which is referenced in
        paragraph 1.4, Applicable Documents.

        Data can be transferred between the IOM Central and either core
        storage or an indirect data channel in byte sizes of 9, 36 and 72
        bits.

1.2     OVERHEAD CHANNELS

        An overhead channel is a non-optional part of the IOM Central that
        provides a specific function and has some of the characteristics

        of a payload channel (i.e., uses the interface bus, competes with
        payload channels for service, has channel numbers, uses some mail-
        boxes, etc.).

1.2.1   Bootload Channel

        The bootload channel consists of non-destructive storage implemented
        as an IOM channel. when activated, it forces a limited number of
        interrupt vectors and control words to be stored in core storage,
        reads a record, and places the system into operation. The read is
        initiated by a Connect ($CON) signal the IOM issues to itself.

1.2.2   Connect Channel

        The connect channel controls the distribution of instructions which
        initiate the operation of any addressable channel capable of re-
        ceiving instructions.

1.2.3   System Fault Channel

        The system fault channel is responsible for reporting the occur-
        rence of system fault conditions to the software. System faults
        are abnormal conditions resulting from the failure of hardware or
        system software.  (System software consists of programs supplied
        for the purpose of controlling the operation of the computer sys-
        tem. System software does not include customer or application
        programs. Abnormal conditions in customer programs are reported
        by the affected data channel, and are classed as user faults
        rather than system faults, insofar as it is practical).

1.2.4   Wraparound Channel

        The wraparound channel is a special channel intended for use by
        test and diagnostic software. By means of instructions issued
        to the wraparound channel by the software, the wraparound channel
        will cause the IOM Central to perform any specific type of service
        on behalf of any payload channel number designated in the instruc-
        tion. The wraparound channel includes a data register and a status
        register which can be loaded and stored by means of appropriate
        services so that most data paths and control sequences in the IOM
        Central can be checked under program control.

1.2.5	Snapshot Channel

	The snapshot channel is a special channel for use by test and
        diagnostic software. It permits the software to sample particular
	signals in the IOM Central on the occurrence of events selected by
	the software.

1.2.6	Scratchpad Access Channel

	The scratchpad access channel is a special channel used by the
	operating system and test and diagnostic software. It permits
	the software to read or write from the scratchpad.

1.2.7	Special Status Channel

	The special status channel is a special channel which may be
	accessed by data channel adapters to store status associated
	with a special interrupt.

11.5	DEFINITIONS

	1.5.1 Tally Runout (TRO)

	In this document, a tally runout is a fault, defined as an ex-
	hausted LPW tally field (the contents of LPW bits 24 -35 equal
	to zero), and LPW bits 21 and 22 set to 0, 1, respectively, at
	the time the LPW is taken from its mailbox in core or in scratchpad.

1.5.2	Pre-Tally Runout (PTRO)

	A pre-tally runout is defined as a tally in either a DCW or an
	LPW which will be reduced to zero by the current channel service
	(DCW during data service, LPW during list service).

1.5.3	 List Pointer Word (LPW)

	A word containing an address "pointing" to a list of control
	words, either DCW's or PCW's. NOTE: Only an LPW for a Connect
	Channel may legally point to a PCW.

1.5.4	Data Control Word (DCW)

	A word containing an address indicating the first or current
	word of data in a list of data. IDCW, TDCW, IOTP, IONTP, and
	IOTD are variations of DCW's.

1.5.5	Peripheral Control Word (PCW)

	A word containing the number of the channel to be connected. and, for
	CPI, an instruction or operation to be performed by a peripheral subsystem.

1.5.6	Status Control Word (SCW)

	A word containing an address indicating the first or current
	empty position in a list of status words used by a particular
	channel.

1.5.7	First List Service

	A flag supplied by the channel to the IOM on the first list service
	following a connect. It directs the IOM to access the core LPW
	and LPWE mailboxes whether or not this channel has a scratchpad.

2.0	FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES

2.1	BASIC CHARACTERISTICS

2.1.1	General

	The 6000B IOM will have the following characteristics:

	-  The ability to operate in a GCOS III mode with no Operating
	   System or Slave software programming interface difference
	   over the 6000 IOM design.

	-  The capability of operating in an Extended GCOS or MULTICS
	   mode where addressable memory space to 2^24 locations
	   is possible.

	-  The ability to change MODE by a manually operated configura-
	   tion switch.

	-  The capability of interfacing up to eight (8) 6000B or 6000 System
	   Controllers. There shall be one three position switch for
	   each pair of ports. The following pairs of ports may be
	   interlaced:

			Ports A and B
			Ports C and D
			Ports E and F
			Ports G and H

	   The interlace mode may either be two (address bit 22) or
	   four (address bit 21) word blocks.

	-  Provision for control word scratchpad storage for at least
	   24 payload channels.

	-  The ability to indicate with a configuration switch per port,
	   that either all or half of the address range assigned to a
	   memory port is available.

	-  The ability to support 36, 72 or 9 bit byte channels.

2.1.2	Relationship to 6000 IOM

	The following variations from the standard 6000 IOM are required for
	address extension to 2^24 locations:

	-  Control word mailboxes, interrupt multiplex words, PCW lists,
	   system fault word lists, and status queues will reside in the
	   first 256K core. DCW's may reside in either the first 256K
	   block or in the same 256K block as the data (depending upon
	   LPW bit 20).

	-  Transactions which cause addresses to be incremented will not
	   be allowed to occur across modulo 256K (absolute) boundaries.
	   That is, overflow past 2^18 is not allowed.

	-  The "address extension" (i.e., the 6 most significant bits of
	   a 24-bit address field) will be used for all data transfers
	   and, depending on LPW 20, may also be used when fetching a DCW
	   during a list service. It will be obtained from the following
	   sources:

	   1)  From bits (12-17) of a PCW directed to a data channel in
	       the Extended GCOS mode.

	       Restrictions: None.

	   2)  During a list service from bits (12-17) of an IDCW directed
	       to a data channel provided IDCW 21=1.

	       Restrictions: None.

2.2	CONFIGURATIONS

2.2.1	Basic IOM Central

	The basic IOM Central has one connect channel, one system fault
	channel, one wraparound channel, one snapshot channel, one boot-
	load channel, one scratchpad access channel, and one special
	status channel. No payload channels, system controller ports or
	scratchpads are included. Space is provided for 36 payload channel
	boards, one of which is used for the wraparound channel.

2.2.2	Options

	o   The 6000B IOM cabinet must be capable of supporting all the
            options listed in the Option Application Data List, 43B240276.
            A subset of these includes: from one to eight Ports to connect
            to 6000B or 6000 System Controllers.

	o   Provisions for adding space for 19 additional payload channel
            boards to the basic IOM.

	o   Payload Channels: The following payload channels may be used
            with the IOM:


		6000B IOM Common Peripheral Channel (2 board spaces per
		channel required)

		6000B IOM Peripheral Subsystem Interface Adapter
		(3 board spaces per channel required)

		6000B IOM Direct Channel (1 board space per channel required)

		6000B IOM Console Channel Adapter (3 board spaces required
		for each two channels)

	o   Scratchpad: Scratchpads may be supplied for storage of control
	    words. Scratchpads are added in groups of 16 channels. A
	    maximum of 32 payload channels may be handled by the scratchpads.

	    When scratchpad modules are used, the channels whose control
	    words are stored in the scratchpad will be determined on the
	    basis of channel number, as follows:

	    The first optional scratchpad module is used for storage of
	    control words for channels numbered 010(8)-027(8).

	    The second optional scratchpad module is used for storage of
	    control words for channels numbered 030(8)-047(8).

2.3	DATA TRANSFER RATES

	The IOM Central will be capable of performing only one storage
	access cycle at any one time, regardless of the number of System
	Controllers to which it may be connected. When connected to a
	6000B System Controller which is kept extremely busy by compe-
	tition from processors and/or other IOM's, the IOM must be capable
	of requesting the next access cycle quickly enough to obtain every
	fourth cycle of the same bank of core storage.

	The following conditions are assumed in specifying the data trans-
	fer rate capability:

	1)  The referenced System Controller and core store are con-
	    tinuously busy.
	2)  Several channels of the same type are operating simultaneously
	    to achieve the stated maximum transfer rate. (No single chan-
	    nel is required to be serviced at the stated maximum rate.)

	3)  Statement of the quantity of words per second further assumes
	    a channel operating in double precision; 72 bits or two 36-bit
	    words per access.

	4)  Data transfers in each direction (Reads and Writes) are
	    equally probable.

	5)  Nominal circuit delay times are assumed.

	6)  Turn around times at IOM interface with 50 foot cables will be
	    assumed as follows: (a) $INT to $DA with 0.5 microsecond
	    memory = 820 nanoseconds; (b) $INT to $DA with 1.2 microseconds
	    memory = 1500 nanoseconds.

	Based on these assumptions, the following minimum capability of
	data transfer rates (total data throughput) are required of the
	IOM Central:

	1) Using a 6000B System Controller and store, and indirect data
	   channels operating without a scratchpad: one data access
	   every 4.5 microseconds, or 440,000 words per second when using
	   a 0.5 microsecond store and one data access every 9.3 micro-
	   seconds or 215,000 words per second when using a 1.2 micro-
	   second store.

	2) Using a 6000B System Controller and store, and either direct
	   channels or indirect channels operating with a scratchpad:
	   one data access every 2.0 microseconds, or 1,000,000 words
	   per second when using a 0.5 microsecond store and one data
	   access every 3.2 microseconds or 625,000 words per second
	   when using a 1.2 microsecond store.

                                                      ----------------------

2.4	CONCURRENT OPERATION

	The time required for the IOM Central to perform an indirect data
	service (and consequently for other types of service) is intended
	to be substantially less than the time required for the requesting
	channel to accumulate or disperse the data. As a result, the IOM

	Central will be time shared by a number of channels operating con-
	currently. The IOM Central provides appropriate services to the
	channels, one at a time. Such concurrent operation of channels
	will be successful only if the fraction of available service time
	used by each channel, summed over all concurrently operating chan-
	nels is less than one, and if there is a sufficient amount of
	buffering in each concurrently operating channel.

2.5	DATA FORMATS

	An indirect data channel may work with byte sizes of 9, 36 or 72
	bits. The IOM Central is capable of packing successive 9 bit bytes
	received from an indirect data channel into successive 9 bit byte
	positions, left to right, in a 36-bit word. It also may unpack
	9 bit bytes from successive byte positions in a 36-bit word,
	left to right, for transmission to an indirect data channel. The
	Common Peripheral Channel will perform its own packing and unpacking.

	Evolving system configurations and peripheral data transfer rates
	emphasize the need to fully utilize the available 6000B system con-
	troller interface, not only to maximize IOM thruput but to minimize
	I/O interference with storage access by system processors. The use
	of a 72 bit interface can result in a thruput increase when operat-
	ing with a channel capable of buffering the 72-bit data width. The
	IOM Central design will incorporate the 72-bit data transfer capa-
	bility.

	Thus for indirect data channels the data in core store can be for-
	matted as 

	    o  one  9-bit character per access
	    o  one 36-bit word per access
	    o  two 36-bit words per access

	The formatting chosen for programming purposes must be consistent
	with the character size used by the indirect data channel. The
	3-bit codes shown in the following formats identify the various
	character positions within a word. Each type of indirect data
	channel determines which of the three formats can be used. A 36-
	bit channel will access one 36-bit word per access, and a 72-bit
	channel may access either one or two 36-bit words per access,
	depending upon the address and tally requirements.

2.5	DATA FORMATS (continued)
	All direct channels are word channels; a word channel may be
	either direct or indirect.

	A word channel transfers one or two 36-bit words at a time, al-
	though each 36-bit word may be effectively subdivided into
	characters by the channel.

3.0	SOFTWARE AND CUSTOMER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS

	The following is a description of a typical operation of the IOM
	and an indirect data channel, such as a Common Peripheral Channel.
	Exceptions to this description arise at many places, but discus-
	sion of these is- held for detailed description further into the
	EPS.

	The software must prepare several control words, in addition to
	a buffer area for data to be transferred. Data Control Words
	indicating the locations of each data area must be placed in a
	DCW list. A List Pointer Word (LPW) indicating the location of
	the DCW list must then be placed in the core LPW mailbox for the
	channel to be used.

	For the purpose of this discussion, assume that channel 020(8), a
	payload channel, is to be issued an instruction to transfer data
	(Write) to the peripheral attached to its interface. A Status
	Control Word placed in the same channels SCW mailbox area points
	to an area of core set aside to receive the status words result-
	ing from the peripheral instructions to be issued. A Peripheral
	Control Word containing the necessary channel and peripheral in-
	struction codes is placed in another area of core, with a second
	word containing the channel number (020) of the channel under
	discussion. The LPW mailbox for the connect channel is provided
	with a pointer to a list of such PCW's, allowing several payload
	channels to be initiated with a single connect instruction. As
	described later, the entire mailbox area is a contiguous block
	of words, four per channel, relocatable by means of switches on
	the IOM Configuration Panel.

	Operation in the IOM begins with the receipt of the $CON from a
	system controller, issued as a result of a connect instruction.
	The $CON causes the connect channel to request the IOM to perform
	a List Service. The IOM uses the LPW from the Connect Channel
	mailbox to obtain the PCW referencing channel 020. The Connect
	Channel LPW is updated and replaced in core after each payload
	channel has been given its PCW. The channel, which is here
	assumed to be receptive, stores the PCW from the connect chan-
	nel, and initiates communication with its attached peripheral.

3.0	SOFTWARE AND CUSTOMER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS (continued)

	When the channel has determined that its peripheral is receptive
	to the instruction, the channel will request the IOM to perform
	a first list service, using the LPW in channel 020 core mailbox to ob-
	tain a DCW. The DCW is checked for several conditions, including
	absolutizing the address when specified, and placed in either* the
	core or scratchpad mailbox for channel 020. This particular DCW
	should be either an IOTP or an IOTD (I/O Transfer and Proceed or
	I/O Transfer and Disconnect). The LPW is updated and placed in
	both core and scratchpad mailboxes for channel 020. The channel
	now requests a data service of IOM, specifying an indirect data
	load. The IOM.uses the DCW                             for chan-
	nel 02O to obtain the first word or word pair from the data area
	in core specified by the DCW. The address and tally fields are
	updated and checked, and the DCW returned to the mailbox in core*
	or in scratchpad. The channel sends a release to the peripheral
	when its output buffers are full.

	The peripheral will subsequently request the data to be sent over
	its interface data lines. By a succession of Data and List Ser-
	vice requests, the channel will continue to supply data until one
	of the following types of events occur: (1) An abnormal status
	condition such as a parity error; (2) The peripheral has reached
	a termination condition; (3) All DCW's in the list including the
	final IOTD are exhausted.

	Anything which causes the end of operation with the peripheral
	with the exception of a system fault, will cause the channel to re-
	quest the IOM to do a status service. Using the Status Control Word
	for channel 020, the IOM will store status in the status queue indi-
	cated by the SCW, update the SCW and restore it to the core mailbox.

	Following the status service, the channel will request the IOM to
	do a multiplex interrupt service. Using a combination of con-
	figuration switches and interrupt level indication in the service
	request, the IOM will retrieve one of 32 interrupt multiplex words,
	set a bit to indicate which channel is causing the interrupt and
	restore the word, then finally set the corresponding interrupt
	cell in the system controller. This will inform the software
	that the sequence of operations is concluded.

3.1	SOFTWARE INTERFACE

	The IOM is responsible for moving information between core stor-
	age and various peripheral devices as controlled by demand from
	the peripheral control units associated with the peripheral de-
	vices. These operations do not occur continuously, but are ini-
	tiated by connects, controlled by control words, and their com-
	pletions are indicated by program interrupts.

3.1.1	Connects

	The software initiates a new activity in the IOM by executing a
	CIOC (Connect) instruction directed to a System Controller port
	that is attached to the IOM. When a processor executes such an
	instruction, the System Controller sends a $CON signal to the
	IOM Central, which activates its connect channel. The connect
	channel initiates.the operation of one or more channels as de-
	scribed in paragraph 3.7, Connect Channel.

3.1.2	Control Words

	The IOM Central makes use of four 36-bit control words for each
	indirect channel:

	o  List Pointer Word (LPW)
	o  List Pointer Word Extension (LPW extension)
	o  Status Control Word (SCW)
	o  Data Control Word (DCW)


	Refer to paragraph 3.2 for descriptions and locations of these
	control words.

3.1.3	Program Interrupts

	The IOM must inform the processor of the completion of a pre-
	viously initiated activity or of the occurrence of other special
	events such as special interrupts from a peripheral, marker inter-
	rupts* from a channel, termination of an activity because of ab-
	normal status, or fault conditions requiring attention of the
	software.

	The IOM accomplishes this by setting a predetermined program
	interrupt cell in the system controller that contains the IOM
	base address. The system controller then causes a program inter-
	rupt in a processor so that appropriate action can be taken by
	the software. Each IOM has access to its own set of eight inter-
	rupt cells in the maximum set of 32 cells. The selection of the
	interrupt level, and the cell associated with the level, is de-
	termined by the channel. This is further described in paragraph
	3.2.7.
- - -
*The marker interrupt indicates the normal completion of a PCW or an
IDCW in a DCW list. This interrupt is under control of the Marker
and Continue bits in the PCW or IDCW.

3.2	CONTROL WORD FORMATS

	The software is responsible for generating certain control words
	and for making these control words available to the IOM hardware
	by placing the control words in appropriate locations in core
	storage. The control words that the software is responsible for
	are:

	o  List Pointer Words (LPW - see paragraph 3.2.1)
	o  Peripheral Control Words - (PCW - see paragraph 3.2.2)
	o  Data Control Words (DCW - see paragraph 3.2.3)
	o  Status Control Words (SCW - see paragraph 3.2.4)

	The IOM hardware is responsible for generating certain words and
	for making these words available to the software by placing them
	in appropriate locations in core storage. These may also be re-
	garded as control words, since the correct operation of the IOM
	can only occur when there is appropriate interaction between the
	IOM hardware and the software. The response words that the IOM
	Central Hardware is responsible for are:

	o Status Words (see paragraph 3.2.5)
	o Fault Words (see paragraph 3.2.6)
	o Interrupt Multiplex Words (IMW - see paragraph 3.2.7)

3.2.1	List Pointer Words LPW and LPW Extension

	The LPW is used to define the location and length of a list of

	o PCW's to be issued by the connect channel, or
	o DCW's to control the operation of a data channel.

	The LPW, together with the LPW extension, also includes fields
	which control

	o the updating of the LPW
	o checking of DCW's for validity.

	The software must generate an LPW and LPW extension for the spe-
	cific data channel and place them in the appropriate locations in
	the core storage mailbox area before initiating the operation of
	that data channel by means of a PCW. The software must also
	generate an LPW for the connect channel and place it in the mail-
	box area before executing a CIOC instruction to initiate the
	operation of the connect channel.

3.2.1

3.2.1	List Pointer Words (LPW and LPW Extension) (continued)

	After the operation of a channel has been initiated, the IOM
	Central hardware must place into the LPW extension (in core and in
	scratchpad when available) the absolute address of each Instruction
	DCW which it encounters while servicing the list. (These are des-
	cribed in paragraph 3.2.3.)

	The LPW and LPW extension have the formats shown below:

3.2.1	List Pointer Words (LPW and LPW Extension) (continued)

	The various fields are defined as follows:

	DCW (or PCW) Pointer (LPW 0-17) - Provides the least significant 18
	bits of a 24 bit address of the DCW or PCW list. The most significant
	six address bits of the DCW depend on the state of LPW 20 (see below).
	Updating of this field is controlled by the NC (no change), TAL
	(Tally Control) and tally fields as shown in Table 3.2.1. When
	updating is called for, the IOM Central increments this field by
	one (two if the channel is the connect channel) during each list
	service.

	Restricted Bit (LPW 18) - Provides the software with a way to restrict
	the use of Instruction DCW's by users without having to scan all DCW
	lists. If this bit is one and an Instruction DCW is encountered by the
	IOM Central, it will abort the I/O transaction and indicate a User
	Fault: Instruction DCW in Restricted Mode to the channel. If bit 18
	is a zero, the list is unrestricted and Instruction DCW's will be
	allowed. (Bit 18 of the LPW for the connect channel must be set to
	zero by the software to preserve future compatibility and will be
	ignored by the IOM Central.) When the IOM Central encounters a
	Transfer DCW (TDCW) during a list service, it will at that time
	logically OR TDCW bit 34 into LPW bit 18 to provide the software with
	a way to switch immediately from unrestricted to restricted operation
	dynamically. Any subsequent encounter with an IDCW (Instruction DCW)
	will cause a user fault for that channel if the LPW bit 18 has been
	set to 1 by the TDCW. There will be no way to switch dynamically
	from restricted to unrestricted operation. Only replacing the LPW
	and issuing a CIOC for the restricted channel will restore the
	unrestricted operation. In addition, only unrestricted users may
	have TDCW 33 = 1 (i.e., change LPW 20). Note: An exception occurs
	during a Reverse List Service where LPW Bit 18 is unconditionally
	reset.

	REL (LPW 19) - Reserved for storage of REL flag (bit 23) condition
	at the time an IDCW was fetched, or whenever a first list service
	was performed.

	AE (LPW 20) - Is defined as the Address Extension flag. This bit
	defines when a DCW list shall be located in the first 256K of core
	(LPW 20 = 0), or that it shall be in the 256K block specified via
	address extension (LPW 20 = 1). This bit may be changed from a zero
	to a one via a transfer type DCW, and will be reset to zero during a
	Reverse List Service if the system is an Extended GCOS system. In
	a Multics system this bit (if set) will follow the state of LPW bit
	19. A system fault will be reported if LPW 20 = 1 in standard GCOS
	mode.

3.2.1	LPW and LPW Extension (continued)

	NC - No Change (LPW 21) - Provides the software with a way to control
	the updating of the LPW (both address and tally fields) as shown in
	Table 3.2.1. When set to a one, bit 21 inhibits the updating of the
	address and tally fields of the LPW. It forces a PTRO to be indicated
	for a Connect Channel service regardless of the state of LPW bit 22.

	TAL - Tally Indication Control (LPW 22) - Provides the software with a
	way to control the recognition of PTRO (Pre-Tally Run-Out) condition
	by all channels as shown in Table 3.2.1. When set to a one, bit 22
	allows the recognition of PTRO and TRO; when zero, these conditions are
	not indicated, and a tally of zero will not cause a fault indication.
	For the connect channel, the combination TAL and NC = 0 will cause a system
	fault. This bit is overridden by LPW bit 21, NC.

	REL (LPW 23) - Provides the software with a way to control the inter-
	lute or relative. Depending on whether this bit is zero or one, each
	DCW address is treated as absolute or relative, respectively. The
	for boundary errors (see description of lower bound and size fields
	of LPW). Bit 23 of the LPW for the connect channel will be ignored
	by the IOM Central. When the IOM Central encounters a TDCW during a
	list service it will logically OR TDCW bit 35 into LPW bit 23 to pro-
	vide software with a way to switch immediately from absolute to rela-
	tive operation dynamically. On a reverse list service bit 19 of the
	LPW will replace bit 23. There will be no way to switch from relative
	to absolute operation except by a new LPW and connect (CIOC). For
	direct channels which use list service to obtain a DCW, no conversion
	of addresses.in the DCW is possible; the program must provide absolute
	addresses, and LPW bit 23 should be zero for future compatibility.



	Tally (LPW 24-35) - Defines the number of PCW's or DCW's remaining in
	the list. Updating of this field by the IOM Central is controlled by
	the NC, TAL, and the value of the tally, as shown in Table 3.2.1.
	When updating is called for, the IOM Central decrements this field
	by one during each list service. Upon detecting a TRO condition for
	a channel as defined in Table 3.2.1, the IOM Central will indicate
	a User Fault: LPW TRO to the channel. (A System Fault: LPW TRO will
	be indicated if the list service is for the connect channel.) The
	tally is decremented when a transfer DCW is encountered and is decre-
	mented again when the next DCW is pulled after the transfer has occurred.

	The payload channel never gets a PTRO indication. It must determine
	when to stop requesting list service on the basis of information in
	DCW or on the basis of some external influence.

3.2.1	List Pointer Words (LPW and LPW Extension) (continued)

	Lower Bound LPW Ext. 0-8 and Size LPW Ext. 9-17 - Provide
	the software         with a way of effectively setting
	up a base address register for each data channel. During a
	list service, if the REL bit (LPW 23) is one, the IOM Central
	checks the address and tally of the new DCW for possible boun-
	dary errors and, provided there is no boundary error, converts
	the relative address to an absolute address which is then
	placed in the DCW mailbox (or scratchpad).  No checking or
	conversion is performed by the IOM Central if the REL bit is
	zero.

	Pointer to First DCW of Most Recent Instruction (LPW Ext. 18-35) -
	Will be updated by the IOM Central during the first list service
	after a PCW, and during any list service which encounters an
	Instruction DCW.  Each time that this field is updated, the
	IOM Central will copy the DCW pointer field of the LPW (or the
	transfer DCW, if one is encountered) into this field of the LPW
	extension in core, and in scratchpad when available.  Thus, if
	the most recent instruction was a PCW, this field will point to
	the first data DCW; if the most recent instruction was an In-
	struction DCW, this field will point to the Instruction DCW.
	It is possible for the software to determine how many instruc-
	tions were executed by the IOM before an abnormal termination,
	by examining this field of the LPW extension in the core mail-
	box after termination. This field will be used as the DCW Pointer
	(LPW 0-17) on a reverse list service.

3.2.2	Peripheral Control Words (PCW)

	The PCW is used by the Connect Channel to initiate the operation
	of a channel, or to mask (turn off) the operation of a channel
	that was previously initiated.  The software can issue one or
	more PCW's with a single CIOC instruction by arranging the PCW's
	in a list and setting up an LPW for the Connect Channel to de-
	fine the location and length of the list.

	A non-PCW word (bits 18-20 not =111) encountered during a list service by the
	connect channel will cause a system fault.  The PCW list should not con-
	tain more than one PCW for any one channel, unless the EPS-1
	for that channel explicitly permits such operation.

	Each PCW fills two words of core and must occupy a y-pair, that
	is, a pair of words obtained by a double-precision core access.
	A list of PCW's must occupy sequential y-pairs.

3.2.2	Peripheral Control Words (PCW) (continued)

	The PCW for all payload channels has the format shown below.
	The PCW for the snapshot channel is shown in paragraph 3.8; the
	PCW for the wraparound channel is in 3.9.1; and the PCW for the
	scratchpad access channel in 3.11.

	The software must be aware of the channel type and peripheral
	subsystem characteristics before writing more than one PCW for
	the same channel in the PCW list. In order to issue more than
	one command to the common peripheral channel for instance, sub-
	sequent commands must appear in the DCW list as IDCW's.

                                Odd Word

	All 36 bits of the even word.of the PCW are sent to the channel
	whose channel number is specified in the Odd Word of the PCW.
	Bits 18-20 of the Even Word must be 111(2)2 or 7(8) to identify the
	word as a PCW.

	Bits 12-17 contain the address extension which is maintained by
	the channel for subsequent use by the IOM in generating a 24-bit
	for the extended address modes.

	A channel will change from the normal condition to a masked con-
	dition as a result of a System Initialize, a system fault flag
	from the IOM Central, or as a result of a PCW with bit 21 = 1.
	This masked condition is a state in which a channel will not re-
	quest service in spite of a need for such service that may be
	generated in the channel. A channel will change from the masked
	condition to normal as a result of a PCW with bit 21 = 0.

3.2.2	Peripheral Control Words (PCW) (continued)

	The interpretation of channel information fields (even word of
	the PCW) by the channels will be specified separately for each
	type of channel in the EPS-1 for that channel. In general, a
	channel uses the information for such things as device instruc-
	tion, device code, or address, mask, channel instruction, re-
	cord count, single character, storage address (direct channels),
	and peripheral storage address. The even word of the PCW is
	sent to the channel specified without rearrangement.

	The odd word is used only by IOM Central, and is not sent to
	the channel. A 9-bit field is reserved for channel number,
	but only 6 bits are implemented. The six-bit channel number
	is extracted from the odd PCW word and is output to the channels
	on lines separate from those used to output the even PCW word.
	Bits 0, 1 and 2 must be zero, for future compatibility; these
	and bits 9-35 are not used by the IOM.

3.2.3	Data Control Word (DCW)

	The IOM Central recognizes five different types of DCW's. These
	are:

	   o   Instruction DCW (IDCW)
	   o   Transfer DCW (TDCW)
	   o   I/O Transfer & Disconnect (IOTD)
	   o   I/O Transfer & Proceed (IOTP)
	   o   I/O Nontransfer & Proceed (IONTP)

	The software or user program must generate appropriate DCW's for
	each data channel, and arrange the DCW's for each channel in a
	list. The list of DCW's for a channel must occupy sequential
	storage locations, except where one list is linked to another
	list by a TDCW. Boundary checks are made for DCW's (if REL
	bit = 1). Refer to paragraph 3.3 for a description of boun-
	dary checking.

3.2.3.1	Instruction DCW

	The IDCW provides the software and unrestricted user programs
	with the ability to imbed instructions for peripheral devices
	at appropriate predetermined places in the DCW list.

	The format of the IDCW is similar to the format of the PCW.
	There is no counterpart in the IDCW for the PCW Odd Word (which
	specifies the number of the channel that is to receive the PCW).

	0               11 12             17 18    20 21                       35
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| INTERPRETED BY  |  ADDRESS        |  111   | E |   INTERPRETED BY     |
	|    CHANNEL      | EXTENSION       |        | C |     CHANNEL          |
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The only field in the IDCW that is interpreted by the IOM Central
	is bits 18-20, which must be coded 111(2) or 7(8), to identify the
	DCW as an IDCW. When the IDCW is encountered during a list service,
	all 36 bits of the IDCW are sent to the data channel. If EC - Bit
	21 = 1, the channel will replace the present address extension with
	the new address extension in bits 12-17. The address extension
	will be unaltered if EC - Bit 21 = 0. In Multics and NSA systems,
	EC - Bit 21 is inhibited from the payload channel if LPW bit 23 = 1.
	The interpretation of the remainder of the IDCW by the data channel
	will be specified separately for each type of channel in the EPS-1
	for the channel. In general, a channel uses the information for
	such things as device instruction, channel instruction, record count,
	single character, core address (direct channels), and peripheral
	storage address.

3.2.3.2	Transfer DCW

	The TDCW provides the software and the user with the ability to
	change control bits and to link one DCW list to another DCW list.
	The format of the TDCW is shown below. Bits 24-32 are not used
	by IOM Central.

                              OR'd with LPW 23 into LPW 23--------------
 

	DCW Pointer (0-17) - Specifies bits 6-23 of the address (absolute
	or relative, depending on the REL bit in the LPW) of the next DCW.
	The IOM Central absolutizes the address, if necessary, and places
	bits 6-23 of the absolute address in the DCW Pointer Field of the
	LPW, so that subsequent DCW's will be obtained from the new list.
	The most significant six bits (address extension) of the next DCW
	address are implied to be zero if LPW 20 = 0. If LPW 20 = 1, the
	address extension will be the present address extension held by the
	channel. 

 

	Bits 18-20 - Some code other than 111.

	Bit 21 - Must be zero.

	Bits 22-23 - Must coded 10(2) to identify the DCW as a TDCW.

	Bits 24-32 - Must be zero.

	Bit 33 - In All but STD GCOS Mode may be used to conditionally
	change LPW 20 from a zero to a one. That is, if TDCW 33 = 1 and
	if bit 18 of the present LPW is zero (unrestricted), LPW 20 will
	be set to a one. This will allow (system) software to control
	when the address extension bits from the PCW or IDCW will be used
	for accessing the users DCW list. Transfer DCW 33 = 1 and LPW 18 = 1
	(restricted) is a user fault. In STD GCOS, if TDCW 33 = 1, LPW 20
	will be set to a one and cause a system fault.

3.2.3.2	Transfer DCW (continued)

	Bit 34 - Is logically 0Red into LPW bit 18 by the IOM to provide
	the program with a way to switch from unrestricted to restricted
	operation.

	Bit 35 - Is logically ORed into LPW bit 23 by the IOM to provide
	the program with a way to switch from absolute to relative opera-
	tion.

	A status of "User Fault:Two Sequential TDCW's" will be indicated
	to the channel and the I/O transaction will be aborted if the DCW
	Pointer field of a TDCW points to another TDCW. (See paragraph 4.5.)

3.2.3.3	I/O Transfer and Disconnect (IOTD)
	I/O Transfer and Proceed (IOTP)
	I/O Non-Transfer and Proceed (IONTP) 

	Each of these three types of DCW's defines a block of data in
	core which may be transferred. The DCW format is shown below.

0                                 17 18   20  21 22  23 24             35

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Data Address (0-17) - Specifies the least significant 18 bits of
	the starting address of the block of data, and is treated as either
	absolute or relative, depending on the REL bit in the LPW. The
	address extension, Bits 0-5, is obtained from the channel and ap-
	pended to form a 24-bit address. If the LPW REL bit is a one, the
	address is absolutized and tested for boundary errors. The data
	address field of an IONTP type of DCW is not used to access core,
	but is updated normally by the IOM Central.

3.2.3.3	I/O Transfer and Disconnect (IOTD)
	I/O Transfer and Proceed (IDTP)
	I/O Non-Transfer and Proceed (IONTP) (continued)

	CP-Character Position (18 - 20) - Specifies the position of the
	first character within the first word of the block. The byte
	size, defined by the channel, determines what CP values are valid:

	   6 bit byte 000,001,010,011,100,101
	   9 bit byte 000,001,010,011
	  18 bit byte 000,001
	  36 bit byte any except 111

	For word channels which assemble bytes into words, or disassemble
	words into bytes, the CP field is sent from IOM Central to the
	channel during list service, and is zeros when placed in the DCW
	mailbox for subsequent data services for that channel. Only full
	words are tallied for word channels.

	For sub-word channels (limited to 9-bit byte channels), which
	depend on IOM Central for packing and unpacking words, the IOM
	Central will increment the CP field each indirect data access
	until a word is filled or emptied (indicated by being incremented
	to a value greater than is shown above for that byte size). When
	this occurs, the CP field is restored to zero, and the address
	field in the DCW is incremented, then the DCW is replaced in the
	mailbox.        A User Fault "Channel Character Size" will be in-
	dicated to the channel, if a character position value greater
	than those indicated above for that channel size is detected by
	 OM Central during list service.                          A CP
	value of 7(8) indicates an IDCW, and is valid for all channel sizes
	during a list service. It will cause a system fault during a
	data service.

	NOTE: A character position value of 110(2) will be passed to the
	channel if the channel indicates that it is a word chan-
	nel, (e.g., the IOM Central does not detect this as a
	fault). It is the responsibility of the channel to in-
	dicate a fault and the EPS-1 for the specific channel
	should be referenced.

3.2.3.3	I/O Transfer and Disconnect (IOTD)
	I/O Transfer and Proceed (IOTP)
	I/O Non-Transfer and Proceed (IONTP) (continued)

	Mod 64 Bit (21) - Data new 21 was defined on the 655 IOM to be
	used, if a sub-word (character) channel were defined, to specify
	the manner of DCW tally update. That is, tally updating would
	be done once per word or once per character. For the 6000B IOM,
	tally will be on a word basis if a 9-bit character channel is
	ever defined. This bit is logically disabled from interrogation
	by the payload channels in the 6000B IOM.

	Type (22-23) must be coded to identify the type of DCW.

	   00 IOTD   I/O Transfer and Disconnect. The current device
	             instruction is ended (terminated) when the channel
	             detects the tally run-out condition of the tally.

	   O1 IOTP   I/O Transfer and Proceed. The current device in-
	             struction proceeds to a new DCW when the channel
	             detects the tally run-out condition of the tally.

	   10        See Section 3.2.3.2 on Transfer DCW (TDCW).

	   11 IONTP  Same as IOTP except that no core accesses are made.
	             If data is being read from a peripheral device, the
	             block of data is discarded. If data is being written
	             to a peripheral device, the IOM Central generates a
	             block of zeros.

	I/O Transfer and Disconnect (IOTD)
	I/O Transfer and Proceed (IOTP)    (continued)

	Tally (24 - 35) - Defines the number of words in the data block.
	An initial tally of 0000(8) will be interpreted as 10000(8) or 4096(10)
	by the IOM Central. When a 72 bit transfer takes place, the IOM
	Central must decrement the Word Tally by 2 each data service.

3.2.4	Status Control Word (SCW)

	The SCW defines the location and length of a status queue in
	core storage. The status queue consists of a number of sequen-
	tial y-pairs, into which the IOM will store status as status
	events occur. Since each channel has its own SCW, there is a
	separate status queue for each channel. The SCW has the format
	shown below.

0                                 17 18  19 20    23 24                35
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
|    ABSOLUTE ADDRESS               |  LQ  |  MBZ   |      TALLY        |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	Status Queue Address (0 - 17) - Provides the least significant
	18 bits of the next absolute address of the status queue to be
	used by the IOM, or the starting address, as determined by the
	software. The IOM will append 6 zeros as the most significant
	address bits for all operating modes. The IOM Central will
	store status in the y-pair defined by the status queue address
	field. Consequently the software should insure that the status
	queue address is even. The IOM Central will increment the status
	queue address by two each time that status is stored in the queue,
	except when the tally is zero (before updating), or for a cir-
	cular queue (see below).

	List/Queue Control (18 - 19) - Will be interpreted for all modes
	as follows:

3.2.4	Status Control Word (SCW)  (continued)

	Circular queue addresses will be incremented after each entry
	until an entry is made in the queue tail. After the queue tail
	entry is made, the address will rotate back to the head of the
	queue.

	The tally of the SCW will be decremented for each status entry
	in either list or queue mode, but the suppression of address
	changes will not occur when the tally has been decremented to
	zero if circular status is called for.

	Bits 20 - 23 are not used, and must be set to zero by the soft-
	ware. These bits are not examined by IOM Central.

	Tally (24 - 35) defines the number of unoccupied y-pairs (72-
	bits) in the status queue. The IOM Central will decrement the
	tally by one each time that status is stored in the queue, ex-
	cept when the tally is zero (before updating). As a result, if
	tally = N, the status queue actually consists of N + 1 y-pairs.
	The (N + 1)th y-pair corresponds to a tally of zero, and is
	therefore subject to being overlaid by subsequent status. SCW
	TRO is not a fault condition. In the circular queue mode the tally
	will continue to be decremented when it reaches zero.

3.2.5	Channel and Device Status Words
	When the IOM Central performs a status service for a channel,
	it will store two words into the y-pair defined by the SCW for
	the channel. These two words will have the following format.

3.2.5	Channel and Device Status Words (continued)

	EVEN WORD:

	Channel and Device Status (0 - 35) will be generated by the chan-
	nel and sent to the IOM Central during the status service. The
	IOM Central will obtain the address extension bits from the chan-
	nel's Transaction Command (for status service), and will "OR"
	them into bits 24-29 of the status word supplied by the channel;
	therefore, the channel must insure that bits 24-29 of the even
	status word are zero. The IOM Central will store the channel and
	device status word in the even word of the y-pair defined by the
	Status Control Word.

	The Common Peripheral Channel Status is shown for illustrative
	purposes only and reference should be made to the EPS-1 for the
	Common Peripheral Channel for explanation of the fields shown.

	ODD WORD:

	The IOM Central will obtain the DCW for the channel (from the
	core mailbox or from the scratchpad, as appropriate) and store
	this DCW residue in the odd word of the y-pair defined by the
	SCW. The information in the DCW residue (as a result of up-
	dating by the IOM Central during data services) must meet the
	following requirements so that it can be properly interpreted
	by software.

3.2.5	Channel and Device Status Words (continued)

	Next Absolute Address (0 - 17) contains bits 6 - 23 of the ab-
	solute address of the word which would have been read or written
	next had the transaction continued.

	Character Position (18 - 20) is the character number into which
	or from which the next character of data would have been trans-
	mitted if the transaction had continued. (Word channels will
	always fill out a word with zeros and store a whole word if the
	transaction stops while reading at a character count other than
	zero, but the last actual character position + 1 will be indi-
	cated in this field.) The IOM Central will obtain the character
	count residue from the channel during a status service, and
	logically OR it into the DCW residue word before storing it as
	status.

	Read (21) will be a one if a peripheral read (core write) opera-
	tion was to be performed. Otherwise it will be zero. The IOM
	Central will obtain the read bit from the channel during a status
	service, and place it into the DCW residue word before storing it as
	status.

	Action Code (22 - 23) is the Action Code of the last DCW obtained
	for this channel.

	Tally Residue (24 - 35) is the residue of the DCW tally, repre-
	senting the number of words which were not accessed.

3.2.6	System Fault Word

	A system fault word is stored as data by the system fault channel
	at the location indicated in the fault channel DCW mailbox when a
	system fault is detected by the IOM Central. The system fault
	word has the following format:


0           8 9                17 18    20 21  22 23 25 26  29 30      35

3.2.7	Interrupt Multiplex Word (IMW)

	The IOM has the ability to set any of the 32 program interrupt
	cells located in the system controller containing the base ad-
	dress of the IOM. It should be noted however that for any given
	IOM identity switch setting, the IOM can set only 8 of these pro-
	gram interrupt cells. The use of this interrupt provision is
	restricted by system assignment of program interrupt cells. The
	IOM uses the 32 interrupt cells in conjunction with the 32 core
	locations in the IOM mailbox area to establish a channel's iden-
	tity. There is a one-to-one correspondence in address between
	the program interrupt cells and the IMW words.

	The IOM Central pulls the IMW from the core location having the
	address determined as follows:

          0         5 6        11 12         18 19 212223

	       |           ---- Mailbox Base Address Switches
	       |
	       ---- Address Extension (Appended Zeros)

	One IMW is provided for each program interrupt cell which can be
	set.by the IOM Central. The particular one of the 32 words in
	the IMW area, and the interrupt cell in the System Controller,
	are determined by two factors:

	a)  The IOM number, as set by the IOM number switches on the
	    maintenance panel, will determine the two least significant
	    bits of the IMW address. This provides one word for each of
	    four possible IOM's at each of eight interrupt levels. The
	    switches are further described in paragraph 3.5.2.

	b)  The interrupt level as determined by the logic in each chan-
	    nel.  The channel will wire, patch, or logically manipulate
	    bit positions 13-15 of the data presented with a program
	    interrupt service request, providing as many as eight pos-
	    sible interrupt levels for each channel from the total of
	    32 levels.  Note that this interrupt level becomes bits 19-21
	    of the TM address once the IOM has appended an address ex-
	    tension of zeros.

3.2.7	Interrupt Multiplex Word (IMW) (continued)

	Thirty-two of the 36 bit positions are used in each of the 32
	IMW words to indicate which channel caused the program interrupt.
	The appropriate IMW is pulled with a Read-Clear access cycle, a
	"one" is ORed into the IMW in the bit position specified by the
	channel, and then the IMW is returned to core with a Clear-Write
	cycle.

	The IOM Central then sets the program interrupt cell that was
	specified by the channel.

	The bit position within the IMW which is to be set to a one is
	determined by the binary value of the five least significant bits
	in the channel number field of the program interrupt service re-
	quest presented by the channel. In the event that more than 32
	channels are used on a single IOM, the higher numbered channels
	will be required to use a different program interrupt level.

	Any special purpose channels designed in the future with a re-
	quirement to set bits in some IMW which do not correspond to its
	own channel number, may still logically manipulate bits 22 - 26
	on one or more Program Interrupt requests, to set any of 32 bits
	in any of 8 words in the IMW area.

	Upon interruption, the supervisory program may examine the core
	location corresponding to the interrupt cell causing the inter-
	rupt to determine which of the channels caused the interrupt.
	The floating normalize instruction may be used effectively for
	this purpose.

	                             Any program interrupt cell may still
	be used as a discrete interrupt by some special purpose channel
	in which case the program would not need to consult the table.
	Figure 3.2.7 depicts the re1ationship between the interrupt cell
	number, IOM channels and the multiplex queue.

3.2.7	Interrupt Multiplex Word (IMW) (continued)

	Note:

	It is important that the System programmer realize that the Interrupt
	Multiplex Word (IMW) update by the IOM requires 2 cycles, a
	Read - CLear (RCL) followed by a Clear - WRite (CWR). That is,
	the process of determining which channel caused an interrupt is
	similar to the gating function. The software must interrogate
	the IMW with an instruction that causes the RCL cycle and trans-
	fers the information to the processor (e.g. LDAC, LDQC). There
	is no other instruction that can provide this capability without
	the possibility of losing information. This hardware technique
	implies that the software may find an IMW of "zero" when responding
	to an interrupt. (i.e. the IOM has performed the RCL and has yet
	to perform the CWR.) If the software does find an IMW (at the
	appropriate level) of "zero" it must read it again (via the RCL).
	This process of repeated fetching should not be an arbitrary loop -
	but rather a procedure that would detect a failure should the IOM
	not perform the CWR cycle.

	When the software fetches the IMW, it may have an indication of
	more than one channel interrupt. It is interesting to note that
	after the software processes these interrupts (if any) an inter-
	rupt present signal may still be present. That means that when
	the waiting interrupt is processed, the interrupt handler may
	find a legitimate "zero" value IMW. This situation should not
	be interpreted as an IOM error but rather the interrupt should
	be effectively ignored by the software.

3.2.7	Interrupt Multiplex Word (IMW) (continued)

	Example:  (all numbers are in decimal)

	Cell 17 is used as a multiplexed cell. Channel 12 uses cell 17
	and shares it with other channels. When channel 12 issues the
	interrupt instruction, the IOM Central reads location 017, then
	alters it by setting a "one" in the bit 12 position, then re-
	writes it back into core, altering only bit 12. Next the IOM
	will actually set interrupt cell 17. The supervisory program,
	when servicing the interrupt, consults location 017 to determine
	which channel has set the cell.

3.3	BOUNDARY CHECKING

3.3.1	Notation

	The following notation will be used to define boundary checking
	and address conversion:

	     A = initial DCW address (relative)

	     S = the number of S12-word blocks addressable by the pro-
	         gram; (size) - S is relative to the Lower Bound; i.e., the
	         number of 512 word blocks "starts" at the Lower Bound.

	     T = initial DCW tally = DCW (24-35)

	     Note: If T = 0000(8)8 it must be treated as 10000(8) by
	           the IOM Central in the boundary check.







	    LB = Lower Bound - LPW Ext. (0-8) = Upper 9 bits of 18 bit
	         address

3.3.2	Check Performed

	1) A User Fault:Boundary Error will be indicated if

	    S + LB - 2^9 > 0

	2)        A User Fault:Boundary Error will be indicated if:
	    for IOTD, IOTP, IONTP;

	        S x 2^9 - A - T < 0 or for TDCW S x 2^9 - A <= 0

	Note: Unlike the 6000 IOM which interpreted size = 0 as a
	User Fault, the 6000B IOM will interpret size = 0 as
	the specifier for 256K (512 consecutive blocks of 512
	words each). The only valid lower bound for size 0 is
	an LB of zero.

3.3.3	Address Result

	If a User Fault does not occur, then the lower 18 bits of the absolute
	address will be:

           8                                          17
          ---                                        ---
          \                                17-N      \               17-N
          /     [(LPW Ext. (N)+DCW (N)) x 2    ] +   /    [DCW(N) x 2    ]
          ---                                        ---
          N=0                                        N=9

3.4	CHANNEL NUMBERING

	The channel number is a 9-bit binary number, usually expressed as
	a 3-digit octal number, which identifies a specific channel for
	both the hardware and the software. Each channel has provision
	for defining its channel number by a patch arrangement in the chan-
	nel. Only the 6 low-order bits of the channel number are to be
	implemented. The high order 3 bits must be zero for upward com-
	patibility.

	Channel numbers are used for the following purposes in the IOM:

	o   A channel recognizes that a PCW is intended for it on the
	    basis of channel number;

	o   The IOM Central uses the channel number supplied by the
	    channel to determine the location of control word mailboxes
	    in core store or in scratchpad;

	o   The IOM Central places the channel number in the system
	    fault word when a system fault is detected and indicated,
	    so that the software will know which channel was affected.

	o   The IOM Central uses the channel number to set a bit in the IMW(see 3.2.7)
	Channel numbers 010(8) - 077(8) may be assigned to payload channels,
	and channel numbers 000(8) - 007(8) are reserved for assignment to
	overhead channels:

	    Channel No.                Overhead Channel Assigned

3.5	MAILBOXES AND STORE MAP

	Communication between software and the IOM depends on an under-
	standing of where control words, such as the LPW, SCW, and IMW,
	are located in storage. To facilitate this, two related base
	addresses are defined by switches on the IOM configuration panel.
	These switches are indicated by X in the diagram below which
	illustrates the relationship between the sets of switches. The
	paragraphs which follow describe the use of the switches relatives
	to a 24 bit address.

3.5.1	Channel Mailbox Base Address Switches

	These 12 switches provide bits 6-17 of the channel mailbox base
	address. The address extension, bits 0-5, and bits 18-23 of this
	base address are zero.

	The following diagram shows how the absolute address of mailbox
	words are determined

0        5 6                       17 18       21 22 23    /
-------------------------------------------------------    | 00 for LPW Mailbox
| Append  |  Channel Mailbox Base   |            |    |    | 01 for LPW Extension
|  Zeros  |  Address     ------------            |  ------<  10 for SCW Mailbox
|         |  Switches    | Channel Number        |    |    | 11 for DCW Mailbox
-------------------------------------------------------    |
                      12 13                                \

	The channel mailbox base address switches are 0Red with the chan-
	nel number. Therefore to avoid ambiguity when channel numbers
	greater than 15 are used, some of the low order bits of the chan-
	nel mailbox base address may be required to be zero.

3.5.2	Interrupt Multiplex Base Address Switches

	Fifteen switches provide bits 6-18, 22, and 23 of the address for
	one of the 32 Interrupt Multiplex words described in paragraph
	3.2.7. Bits 19-21 of this address are provided by the channel,
	as the interrupt level, in the Interrupt Service request. Bits
	6-11 of the Interrupt Multiplex Base Address are set by the same
	switches as bits 6-11 of the Channel Mailbox base address. The
	address extension, bits 0-5, are zeros.

	The switches which provide bits 22 and 23, the two least sig-
	nificant bits of the address, are labeled "IOM Number". These
	two switches, and the 3 bits of interrupt level supplied by the
	channel, select one of the 32 Interrupt cells, and one of the
	Interrupt Multiplex Words relative to the IMW base address.

	IOM's will be configured on a system according to the following
	table:

	             Configuration Order          IOM Number
                     -------------------          ----------

	                  First IOM                0 (00)
	                 Second IOM                1 (01)
	                  Third IOM                2 (10)
	                 Fourth IOM                3 (11)

3.6	SYSTEM FAULT CHANNEL

	The system fault channel controls the indication to the software of
	system faults that are detected by the IOM.

	Once it has been activated by the detection of a system fault, the
	system fault channel obtains an indirect data service from the IOM
	Central. During this indirect data service the system fault word
	is transferred from the fault channel to core under control of the
	DCW for the system fault channel. (Note: the DCW is used in pref-
	erence to the SCW to allow recording of system faults on a most
	recent n, rather than first n-1 and most recent one basis - see
	below.) The system fault channel operates in the indirect-36 mode.
	The system fault channel is the top priority channel, and will be wired
	as number 001(8).

	Immediately after the data service has been completed, without re-
	linquishing control, the system fault channel obtains a program
	interrupt service using level one (without storing status), does a
	list service if necessary and then de-activates itself, waiting
	for another possible system fault.

	The software determined tally of the fault channel DCW should be
	sufficient to allow for several faults occurring in succession.
	when this number is exceeded and the tally reaches zero, the fault
	channel will request a list service before completing the program
	interrupt service. The software determined LPW obtained during
	this service could point to a DCW which will overlay the original
	fault channel DCW and should have the same initial address and
	tally. (NC = 1 in original LPW.) Thus the fixed size queue (n
	words) will cycle and have, at most, the last n fault words.

	The LPW extension and SCW mailboxes for the system fault channel
	are not used by the IOM.

3.7	CONNECT CHANNEL

	The connect channel controls-the distribution of instructions
	which initiate the operation of data channels. The connect
	channel is activated when a $CON signal is received from a sys-
	tem controller by the IOM Central, as a result of a processor
	executing a CIOC instruction or when a $CON is received from the
	bootload channel.

	Once it has been activated the connect channel obtains a list
	service from the IOM Central. During this service the IOM
	Central will do a double precision read from core, under the
	control of the LPW for the connect channel.

	If the IOM Central does not indicate a PTRO during the list
	service, the connect channel obtains another list service.
	when the PTRO is indicated, the connect channel de-activates
	itself, waiting for another $CON. The connect channel does not
	interrupt or store status.

	The channel number of the connect channel will be wired as 002(8).

	The DCW and SCW mailboxes for the connect channel are not used
	by the IOM.

3.8	SNAPSHOT CHANNEL

	The snapshot channel provides the test and diagnostic software
	with a way of sampling control lines and signals in the IOM
	Central at times specified by the software. The snapshot chan-
	nel is activated by a PCW addressed to it.

	The PCW defines the state of the IOM Central at which the snap-
	shot is to occur. This includes such factors as the channel
	number of the channel being serviced, and the type of service,
	as well as the control state of the IOM Central. When the snap-
	shot conditions are met, the specified information is switched
	into the snapshot register and then stored in core as data, under
	control of the DCW for the snapshot channel. Sampling continues
	until a PTRO condition is indicated by the IOM Central. When the
	PTRO is indicated, the snapshot channel obtains a program inter-
	rupt service using level one without storing status) and then
	de-activates itself waiting for another PCW.

	The Snapshot Channel is wired as channel number 3. The LPW,
	LPW extension and SCW in the mailbox area for the Snapshot Chan-
	nel are not used.

	The even word of the PCW for the Snapshot Channel has the follow-
	ing format:

0       4 4     11 12        17 18   20 21 22  23   25 26 27   29 30   32   35

	Explanation of PCW fields: (See note below)

	0-4		Voltage Margin Control

	5-11,31		These bits must be zero.

	12-17		Channel number of channel that is to be in operation
			when the information is strobed into the Snapshot
			Register.

	18-20		These bits are 111 for a PCW.

	21		This bit will mask the snapshot channel if set to "1".

	22		If this bit is "0", the Snapshot Register will be
			strobed the first time the central is in the state
			requested. If the bit is a "1", the strobe will
			occur the second time the central is in the re-
			quested state.

3.8	SNAPSHOT CHANNEL (continued)

			This will be useful during a list service when the IOM
			Central is in the Indirect Cycle Read (ICR) state for
			two (2) storage access cycles, for example.

	23-25		State Code of the IOM Central during which the Snapshot
			Register is to be strobed.  These codes are defined as
			follows:

			    Code

			23   24   25     Central State Referenced

			 0    0    0     IDLE
			 0    0    1     CWP Instruction Word Pull
			 0    1    0     ICR Indirect Cycle Read
			 0    1    1     ICW Indirect Cycle Write
			 1    0    0     RCW Restore Control Word
			 1    0    1     SXC Set Interrupt Cell
			 1    1    0     DIR-R Direct Read
			 1    1    1     DIR-W Direct Read

	26		If this bit is a "1", the Snapshot Register is strobed
			during each Service Request of the desired channel. The
			Snapshot Channel must then have a higher priority than
			the channel observed. Therefore with bit 26 set, in-
			spection of the fault channel will be somewhat restricted.

	27-29		Service Request Code during which the Snapshot Register
			is to be strobed. These codes are defined in paragraph
			A.2.1.

	30		If this bit is a "1", the Snapshot Register will be
			strobed only when the desired channel requests a Double
			Precision Cycle of the Service Request Code indicated in
			bits 26-29 above.

	32-35		The Snapshot Switch Code designates which Central register
			or data path is to be enabled onto the Snapshot Bus. The
			code and contents of the Snapshot Switch which are referenced
			are defined as follows:

3.9	WRAPAROUND CHANNEL (WAC)

	The wraparound channel provides the test and diagnostic software
	with a way of causing the IOM Central to perform specific types
	of service on behalf of a specific channel, designated by the T&D
	software. The wraparound channel is activated by receipt of a
	PCW addressed to it, and assumes the identity of the channel num-
	ber contained in the PCW.

	By appropriate coding of the PCW the following operations can be
	caused to happen:

	o  Load data into the data register of the wraparound channel.

	o  Perform list service (or first list service) in lieu of a
	   specified channel.

	o  Perform status service in lieu of a specified channel.

	o  Perform program interrupt service using specified program inter-
	   rupt cell and multiplex hit number.

	o  Perform indirect data load or store in lieu of a specified
	   channel.

	o  Perform direct load or store using specified storage location.
	o  Perform direct read clear using specified storage location.
	o  Load specified status into status register of the wraparound
	   channel.

	o Cause a system fault, or a user fault.

	After performing the action specified by the PCW, the wraparound
	channel de-activates itself, waiting for another PCW. There is no
	automatic storage of status and no automatic program interrupt
	associated with the operation of the wraparound channel.

	At the end of each service by the Wraparound Channel, I/O bus con-
	trol and flag lines are loaded into the wraparound status register.
	A PCW specifying a status service for the wraparound channel will
	return this information to core, using the SCW for the channel
	specified in the PCW, probably the SCW for the WAC channel.

	The wraparound channel will be wired as channel number 004(8).

	The mailbox area is not used automatically; the SCW should be used
	when accessing the status information stored in the WAC hardware.

	The Wraparound Channel utilizes four word formats:

	1)  Peripheral Control Word (36 bits)
	2)  Data Word, Single Precision(36 bits + parity)
	3)  Data Word, Double Precision (72 bits + 2 parity)
	4)  Status Word (36 bits)

	The PCW fields are described as follows:

	0-17         Contains bits 6-23 of the absolute store address for
	             direct data service.
	                                              Bits 12-17 will be
	             used as address bits 0-5 if bit 26 equals a "1".
	             This field also can contain the Program Interrupt Cell
	             for a Multiplex Program Interrupt Service in bits 13-15.

	18-20        Always 111 for a PCW.

	21-23        Service Request Code which determines the type of ser-
	             vice of an action PCW. These codes are defined as
	             follows:

3.9.1	Peripheral Control Word (PCW) (Continued)

	27 - 29      Action Code - determines operation of the Wraparound
	             Channels as to what action will be performed due to the
	             PCW.

	                      000 = single precision action PCW for data
	                            register #1 (Note 1)

	                            register #2 (Note 1)
	                      010 = double precision action PCW (Note 1)
	                      011 = force an I/O bus parity error on an
	                            indirect data store service
	                      100 = Data PCW for Data Register #1 (Note 2)

	                      110 = Data PCW for the Status Register (Note 2)
	                      111 = Load the I/O bus control flags into the
	                            Status Register during the PCW. No change
	                            to the instruction or Data Register, and no
	                            request is made to Central.

	30 - 35      Test Channel Number - determines the payload channels for
	             which a particular service is being performed.

	Note 1: The action PCW is a PCW which causes the Wraparound Channel to
	perform a specified service, i.e., list, status, etc.

	Note 2: The Data PCW is a PCW which causes the data contained in the PCW
	to be.stored in either of two data registers or a status register,
	depending on the action code. The Wraparound Channel will not make
	any request to the IOM Central when this type of PCW is received.

3.9.2	Data word

	The Data Registers of the Wraparound Channel are loaded from all 36 bits of
	the input data lines by either a data PCW, in which the data of the PCW is
	loaded into the data register, or when a direct/indirect load service is
	specified in an action PCW, The input parity is also loaded.

	The contents of the Data Registers are stored in core when a direct/indirect
	data store service is specified in an action PCW.

3.9.3	Status word

	The wraparound Channel Status Register is loaded from the input
	data-lines when the Wraparound Channel receives a data PCW
	specifying the Status Register. The Status Register is also
	loaded with the I/O Bus Control points and flags at the end of
	each service that the Wraparound Channel performs as a result of
	an action PCW. The bus will also be loaded if the Wraparound
	Channel receives a PCW with an action code of 111.

	The Status Word is stored in core when a Status Service is speci-
	fied in an action PCW. The format of the Status Word in the
	wraparound Channel is then one of the following:

        0                 8,9             23 24          29,30         35

	-----------------------------------------------------------------

	or

        0                 8,9             23 24          29,30         35

	-----------------------------------------------------------------

	In the second case, the fields are designated as follows:

	        Bit 0 = SCN 
	            1 = DTA
	            2 = DBL
	            3 = TLO
	            4 = TL1
	            5 = SYS
	            6 = USO
	            7 = US1
	            8 = US2

                30-25 = Test channel number which was received with
	                the last action PCW (with the exception of
	                the Status Service Request).

	Note: Bit 9 through 23 are not implemented and will always be
	      returned to core as zeros for a status return.

	      Bits 24 - 29 are "OR'ed" in by the IOM Central from the
	      address extension bits in the transaction command.

3.10	BOOTLOAD CHANNEL

	The bootload channel will consist of 11 words of read only storage/
	IOM configuration switches. It will be placed into operation when
	the BOOTLOAD pushbutton at either the System console or the bootload
	section of the Configuration Panel is depressed.

	When the bootload channel is placed into operation, it will cause the
	11 words to be written into core storage and will activate the connect
	channel in the same manner as a $CON signal from the system controller.
	The connect channel will cause a PCW to be sent to the channel speci-
	fied as the boot channel by the configuration switches and will ini-
	tiate transfer of one record from that channel.

	The following configuration switches from the IOM configuration panel
	will be accessible to the bootload channel so that the settings of
	these switches can be stored by the bootload channel as part of the
	bootload program (see Figure 3.10a):

	o  Port (the number of the system controller port to which the IOM is
	   connected)
	o  IOM Mailbox Base Address
	o  IOM Interrupt Multiplex Base Address
	o  IOM Number...0, 1, 2, or 3
	o  Card/Tape Selector
	o  Mag Tape Channel Number
	o  Card Reader Channel Number

	The 6000B boot program shall work on either a CPI or PSI channel. It
	has the following characteristics:

	1. The program is highly dependent on the configuration panel switches.

	2. The program performs the following functions:

	   a. The system fault vector, terminate fault vector, boot device's
	      SCW and the system fault channel's (status) DCW are set up to
	      stop the program if the BOOT is unsuccessful (device offline,
	      system fault, etc.) and to indicate why it failed.

	   b. The connect channel LPW and the boot channel LPW and DCW are
	      set up to read (binary) the first record starting at location 308.
	      This will overlay the terminate interrupt vector and thereby
	      cause the processor to start executing the code from the first
	      record upon receipt of the terminate from reading that record.

	3. The connect channel PCW is treated differently by the CPI channel
	   and the PSI channel. The CPI channel does a store status. The.
	   PSI channel goes into startup.

3.10	BOOTLOAD CHANNEL  (continued)

	The boatload channel is assigned a channel number of 5, but will not
	respond to PCW's-directed to channel 5. Operation of the bootload
	channel will be initiated only by an operator depressing the BOOTLOAD
	pushbutton on the IOM configuration panel or on the system console
	(after first depressing the System Initialize pushbutton). The boot-
	load channel will make no use of the mailbox words set aside for
	channel 5.

	The reading of the first record of magnetic tape or card without
	processor intervention facilitates primitive instruction testing
	by T&D software, without requiring a (possibly) sick processor to
	actively initiate its own testing.

	Figures 3.10a and 3.10b respectively show which configuration panel
	switches are used in BO0Ting, what the boot program looks like.

3.11	SCRATCHPAD ACCESS CHANNEL

	The scratchpad access channel provides the test and diagnostic soft-
	ware with a way of loading or storing the contents of the channel
	mailboxes. By appropriate coding of the PCW the scratchpad mail-
	boxes of a specified channel can be loaded or stored from specified
	locations in core. The channel will access the Scratchpad when it
	is physically present; if a channel has no scratchpad, the mailbox
	in core for that channel will be accessed.

	The scratchpad access channel will be wired as channel number 07.
	The LPW, LPW extension, and SCW mailboxes for the scratchpad access
	channel will not be used by the IOM Central. Only the DCW for
	channel 07(8) will be used.

	The scratchpad access channel will do an indirect data service under
	control of its DCW, reading from scratchpad and storing into core,
	or vice-versa. Upon completion of the transfer, an appropriate
	multiplex interrupt to level one is executed.

	Software should not issue successive connects to the scratchpad
	access channel until the interrupt is received from the previous
	connect; otherwise the action called for by the connect may not be
	performed.

	Format for the PCW using the Scratchpad Access Channel is as
	follows:

	-----------------------------------------------------------------

 

	It may be seen by examination of the PCW that the Scratchpad Access
	Channel is operated by means of the Wraparound Channel. The PCW is
	addressed to the Wraparound Channel, which does a service in lieu
	of the Scratchpad Access Channel using.the DCW for channel 07(8).

3.11	SCRATCHPAD ACCESS CHANNEL (continued)

	The fields in the PCW are defined as follows:

	Even Word:

	   Bits 0-17   Contain bits 6-23 of the absolute address of mailbox,
	               referenced to IOM Mailbox base address switches; i.e.,
	               the switches will be logically 0Red with these bits
	               to form the actual address of a mailbox. The IOM
	               will append zeros for bits 0-5 of the absolute ad-
	               dress. Channels which have standard or optional
	               scratchpad present will have the access directed to
	               the scratchpad. When an address exceeds the address
	               of the last available scratchpad, the access is
	               directed to that mailbox in core. Representative
	               examples are:

                           specified in bits 0-17 of the PCW.

                       101 (Indirect store) Information is taken from the
                           mailbox specified in PCW bits 0-17, and stored
                           in the core location designated by the DCW for
                           the Scratchpad Access Channel.

3.12	MAINTENANCE PANEL AND CONFIGURATION SWITCHES

	In order to provide for both static and dynamic test capability of the IOM
	Central, maintenance functions and Maintenance Panel controls are being
	incorporated to allow simulation of the listed inputs to the Central:

	(a) System Store Data

	(b) Channel Transactions or Service Requests
	(c) Channel Data

	Fault Location Aids

	In addition to the above, which are basically for free-standing test and
	checkout without attachment to or from any other system component, several
	maintenance and test aids will be available for dynamic fault location and
	isolation. Capabilities of these aids are listed below. Note that their
	primary purpose is to facilitate field maintenance; however, their use in
	debug and test will provide needed help-in initial equipment bring-up.

	(a) Single step store cycle
	(b) Single step for IOM;major cycle
	(c) Halt on store address match
	(d) Halt on fault (fault channel number match)
	(e) Halt on IOM control state match
	(f) Halt on channel number match
	(g) Halt on channel request code match

3.12.1	Fault Location Aids (continued)
	Other system configuration and panel switches as required by 6000B
	System EPS-1, referenced in paragraph 1.4; will be included.

3.12.2	Base Addresses

	Channel Mailbox Base Address - Twelve switches on the IOM con-
	figuration panel provide bits 6-17 of the channel mailbox base
	address. The address extension, bits 0-5, and bits 18-23 of this
	base address are zero.

	Interrupt Multiplex Base Address - Bits 0-11 of the Interrupt
	Multiplex Base Address are the same as Bit 0-11 of the Channel
	Mailbox Address and are controlled by the same set of switches.
	Nine switches on the IOM configuration panel provide bits 12-18,
	22, and 23 of the Interrupt Multiplex Base Address. Bits 19-21 of
	this base address are zero.

3.12.3	Software Operating System Control

	A manually-operated three-position configuration switch will be pro-
	vided on the IOM configuration panel to place restrictions on the
	allowable operating system:

	               Position 1 - "Standard GCOS"
	               Position 2 - "Extended GCOS"
	               Position 3 - "MULTICS"

	A set of system and user faults will be reported if the operating
	system attempts to exceed mode constraints.

3.13	SPECIAL STATUS

	PSIA channels have the ability to store special status. All the
	PSIAs on the IOM shall store their special status words using the
	LPW and DCW mailboxes assigned to channel 06. The storage shall
	be on a first come, first serve basis and service for each PSIA
	channel shall be honored on the basis of its individual priority.
	As in the System Fault Channel, the LPW and DCW mailboxes can be
	set up to specify a fixed rotating queue to store the last n spe-
	cial status words. Unlike other channels, the Special Status
	Channel is always busy, and cannot be a scratchpad channel.

	The PSIA channel that stores a special status word in the last
	word of a buffer shall automatically do a list service request
	to obtain a new (or the original) DCW. However, since these re-
	quests shall also be honored based on the priority of that parti-
	cular PSIA channel, it is possible for a higher priority PSIA
	channel to have its store special status request honored before
	the DCW is reinitialized and to therefore overwrite whatever is
	in the word following the status buffer. It is highly unlikely
	that anyone PSIA can delay any other lower PSIA channel more than
	one service. Therefore, to be "safe", any buffer that could be
	used for storing special status for multiple PSIA channels should
	place after it a padding of one word for each PSIA above one PSIA.

4.0	HARDWARE INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS

4.1	STORAGE INTERFACES

4.1.1	System Controller

	The IOM Central will interface with from zero to eight 6000B or
	6000 system controller ports for performing the following types
	of cycles:

	o Read Restore, Single Precision (RRS,SP)
	o Read Restore, Double Precision (RRS,DP)
	o Read, Clear Single Precision (RCL,SP)
	o Clear Write, Single Precision (CWR,SP)
	o Clear Write, Double Precision (CWR,DP)
	o Set Execute Interrupt Cell (SXC)

	In addition, the IOM will respond to a $CON occurring during a
	system controller connect cycle. The IOM will generate and check
	parity on this interface. (See paragraph 4.2.6)

	Scratchpad Storage:

	Each module of the optional scratchpad storage will provide at
	least 48 36-bit words of storage with a complete cycle time of
	less than 500 nanoseconds. The interface to the scratchpad can
	be tailored to the requirements of the IOM Central, although
	full advantage should be taken of the fact that the scratchpad
	store actually substitutes for a portion of core store so that
	similar control functions should be provided.

	PRIORITY

	The I/O bus priority system is based on a channel's physical
	location on the bus - the closer to the physical top of the bus,
	the higher the priority. In addition to the priorities for I/O
	bus resident boards, the IOM Central overhead channels are also
	involved in the total priority system. The priority within
	each I/O bus is fixed. Priority among the I/O buses and the over-
	head channels is also wired and fixed as follows:

	a) Fault Channel (highest priority)
	b) Snapshot Channel (second highest priority)
	c) I/O Bus #1 (Up to 17 Device Channels or 8 Common Peripheral Channels)
	d) I/O Bus #2 (Up to 19 Device Channels or 9 Common Peripheral Channels)
	e) I/O Bus #3 (Up to 19 Device channels or 9 Common Peripheral Channels)
	f) Maintenance Panel
	g) Connect Channel (Lowest Priority)

	(A "Device Channel" may be either a High Speed or a Medium Speed De-
	vice Channel, or a similar type of channel).

4.3	CHANNEL SERVICE

4.3.1	List Service

	Figure 4.3.1 (a,b,c) is a flow diagram of list service. When a
	list service is performed for a channel, the IOM Central pulls
	the LPW and LPW extension for that channel from core or scratch-
	pad. On the first list service following the connect, the chan-
	nel will supply an indication of "First List Service" to IOM
	Central to direct the LPW access to core rather than to scratch-
	pad (See paragraph A.2.1).

	List service is the only way of getting a DCW into scratchpad
	for subsequent data services, other than using the scratchpad
	access channel.

	The IOM Central checks the LPW for Tally conditions.  The LPW
	address defines the location of

	o the next DCW for an indirect data channel, or

	o the next PCW for the connect channel

	The IOM Central pulls the 36-bit DCW or the 72-bit PCW from the
	location determined by the LPW. A direct channel will obtain a
	DCW by a (1) direct data service, supplying the absolute address
	DCW.

	If the service is being performed for a data (payload) channel
	the IOM Central examines the DCW type. If the DCW is an Instruc-
	tion DCW (IDCW), and if the LPW is not restricted against Instruc-
	tion DCW's, the IDCW is treated like a PCW and sent to the channel.

	If the DCW is not an IDCW the IOM Central determines the address
	mode, and absolutizes (and checks) the address, if relative. If
	the DCW is a transfer DCW (TDCW) the DCW Pointer field of the

	LPW is replaced by the TDCW address field. Then this address is
	used to obtain a new DCW (no interruption is allowed). If the DCW
	is an IOTP, IONTP or IOTD, the DCW is written into the core (or
	scratchpad) DCW mailbox. This DCW is also sent to the channel so
	the character position and-type fields can be stored for later use.

	The IOM Central updates its LPW Address and Tally (if not inhibited).
	The LPW is then-returned to the core (and scratchpad) mailbox. If
	the service handled an IDCW the LPW and LPW extension are both returned
	to the mailbox (both core and scratchpad) with the address of the
	IDCW in bits 18 - 35 of the LPW extension.

4.3.2	Backup List Service

	In response to a "backup list service" request from a channel, the
	IOM Central shall regenerate a list pointer word (LPW) and a list
	pointer word extension (LPWX) for that channel and shall continue
	operation on the channel by using the regenerated LPW and LPWX. The
	format of the regenerated LPW shall be:

	    REGENERATED LPW                           SOURCE
            ---------------              ----------------------------

            bits 0 - 17            =     LPWX bits 18 - 35 (the pointer to
                                         the last IDCW)

            bit 18, 20             =     0

            bits 19, 21, 22        =     LPW bits 19, 21, 22

            bit 23                 =     LPW bit 19*

            bits 24 -35            =     LPW bits 24 - 35

	The format of the regenerated LPWX shall be identical to the format
	of the current LPWX.

	The result of executing the regenerated LPW and LPWX shall be a DCW
	fetch from the last location to contain an IDCW. Mode shall be non-
	restricted. Addressing shall be relative or absolute in accordance
	with the contents of LPW bit 19 (equal to REL flag condition at the
	time an IDCW was encountered). Tally shall be equal to the LPW tally
	present at the time of the "backup list service" request. Tally
	control (bits 21 and 22) shall be the same as the current LPW.
	Lower Bound and Size constraints for relative addressing shall be
	the same as the current LPWX.

	The DCW pulled following reconstruction of the LPW must be an IDCW.
	If not, a fault shall be reported by the channel (not by the Central).

	The end result of responding to a "backup list service" request shall
	be a retry (i.e., repeat) of the last command and data transfer se-
	quence entered into for this channel by backing up in the control word
	list to the last command executed and then retracing the list from
	that point.

4.3.3	Indirect Data Service

	Figure 4.3.3a is a flow diagram of indirect data service.  When an
	indirect data service is performed for a channel, the IOM Central
	pulls the channel's DCW from the core mailbox, or from the scratchpad.

----------------------
*The IOM shall load bit 19 with LPW bit 23 each time an IDCW is fetched or

4.3.3	Indirect Data Service (cont.)

	The DCW address defines the location of the data unless the DCW type
	is IONTP. If the channel is performing a peripheral read (core
	write) operation, and the DCW is IONTP, there is no storage cycle
	for data transfer (the data is discarded). If the channel is per-
	forming a peripheral write (core read) operation and the DCW type
	is ONTP, the IOM Central generates a data character or word equal
	to zero and transfers it to the channel.

	The IOM Central updates as appropriate the DCW address, tally and
	character position, and then writes the DCW back into the mailbox
	(core or scratchpad).

4.3.4	Direct Data Service

	The direct data service consists of one core storage cycle (Read Clear, Read
	Restore or Clear Write, Double or Single Precision) using an absolute
	24-bit address supplied by the channel. This service is used by
	"peripherals" capable of providing addresses from an external source,
	such as the 355 Direct Interface Adapter.

4.3.5	Status Service

	Figure 4.3.5a is a flow diagram of status service. When a status
	service is performed for a channel, the IOM Central pulls the
	channel's SCW from the core mailbox.


	The SCW address defines the y-pair where status is to be stored.  The
	status consists of one word of channel and peripheral status obtained
	from the channel, and one word of DCW residue which the IOM Central obtains
	from the DCW mailbox (in core-or scratchpad). Before transferring
	these two words to core the IOM Central inserts character position resi-
	due and read bit from the channel into bits 18-21 of the DCW residue and in-
	serts the channel's address extension bits into bits 24-29 of the channel
	status word.

	If the tally in the SCW is zero and the SCW does not indicate a cir-
	cular queue the IOM Central does not update the SCW address and tally.
	This provides a means for causing all status from a particular chan-
	nel to be stored in the same y-pair in core; If the SCW tally is not
	zero, the IOM Central updates the SCW by adding two to the address and
	by subtracting one from the tally; The SCW is then returned to the
	SCW mailbox in core store. For an SCW which indicates a circular queue
	the IOM Central updates the SCW by adding two to the address and by
	subtracting one from the tally until the end of the queue is reached.
	The SCW then updates the address back to the top of the queue.

4.3.6	Program Interrupt Service (Refer also to paragraphs 3.2.7 and 3.5.2)

	Figure 4.3.6 is a flow diagram of a program interrupt service. When
	such a service is performed for a channel the channel specifies:

	o  which Interrupt Multiplex word is to be used and program
	   interrupt cell is to be set:

	o  which bit is to be set in the Interrupt Multiplex Word (IMW)
	   that corresponds to the program interrupt cell.

	There is one IMW in core for each of the 32 program interrupt cells
	in the System Controller that can be accessed by the IOM (see para-
	graph 3.2.7).

	The Interrupt Cell is determined by the two IOM Identity Switches
	(least significant bits of IMW base, see section 3.5.2) and by the
	Interrupt level specified by the channel in the Interrupt Service
	Request.

	The IMW provides a way for the IOM to indicate which channel caused
	the program interrupt cell to be set. During the interrupt service
	the five least significant bits of.the channel number are used as
	a 5-bit code by the IOM Central to indicate which hit of the allow-
	able 32 bits in the IMW is to be set to one. The IOM Central obtains
	the IOM with a Read Clear to Care, 0R's a one into the bit specified
	by the 5-bit code for the channel into the existing IMW, and returns
	the resulting IOM to the IOM area in core, and then sets the interrupt
	cell.

4.4	PARITY AND DATA INTEGRITY

	Parity will be generated by the central on all data being output to
	the channel. On character-oriented data, the character will be
	right-adjusted, with leading zeros.

	Parity will be checked by the central on data received during Indi-
	rect Store or Direct Store. Parity will not be checked on channel
	requests for services. Parity will not be checked on List, Status,
	or Interrupt services.

	The IOM will maintain a continuous error check, via parity, on
	data transferred, both from storage to the peripheral and vice
	versa. The total path length over which parity is maintained is
	continuous from the cable interface at the system control to the
	cable interface at the peripheral.

	Since the IOM is directly involved in the major GCOS overhead func-
	tion of supervisory module swapping into and out of storage, the
	ability to detect - within the constraints of simple parity error
	limitations - errors as they may occur in this sensitive data swap
	function should allow a measure of protection for system operation
	not previously available in any of our system designs.

	It will be possible to define hardware in new peripheral interface
	adapters such that data integrity is maintainable in a contiguous
	chain at least through the IOM.

	Utilization in the IOM of a scratchpad for storage of control words
	for indirect channels (i.e., those not providing storage for or
	direct control over their own Data Control Words) requires repetitive
	store and retrieve cycles of channel control words from the scratch-
	pad. In order to minimize the probability of an undetected and
	possibly catastrophic data error being introduced in the repeated
	cycles involved, parity will be checked or generated and appended to
	the control words as they are stored in the scratchpad, and checked
	upon retrieval. An exception to this is the cycle involving the
	DCW residue word when the IOM central performs a status service for
	a scratchpad channel. (i.e., parity will not be checked during this
	access).

	FAULTS

	Hardware will be provided in the IOM for the detection and indication
	of abnormal operating conditions, or faults. These are two distinct
	classes of faults; user faults, and system faults.

4.5	FAULTS (cont.)

	     o  User Faults - A user fault is an abnormal condition that can
	        be caused by a user program operating in the slave mode in
	        the processor.

	     o  System Faults - A system fault is an abnormal condition that
	        cannot be caused by a user program operating in slave mode,
	        and therefore is assumed to have been caused by a software
	        error or a hardware malfunction.

	User faults can be detected by the IOM Central or by a channel. If
	a user fault is detected by the IOM Central, the fault is indicated
	to the channel, and the channel is responsible for reporting the user
	fault as status in its regular status queue. A user fault condition
	does not cause the channel to be masked by the hardware, although
	the software may take this action in response to the indication of a
	user fault, if it chooses to.

	System faults are detected by the IOM Central and indicated by the
	system fault channel. The data channel being serviced when the
	system fault was detected is automatically masked by the central.
	in an attempt to protect the system from a recurrence of the fault.

	Because of their nature of timing relationship, certain hardware
	malfunctions also must be reported as user faults.

	ments; bits 21-23 represent "central" status as it was received
	from the central, and bits 18-20 represent "channel" status as deter-
	mined by the channel.

4.5.2.1	Central Status

	"Central" status is defined to be those fault conditions which
	are detected by the central, and which are encoded on the user
	fault flag lines at the completion of service to the channel. The
	channel will place this code in the status word exactly as it is
	received from the central or a 1102 code according to the priorities
	given in that channel s EPS-1.

	Since only three lines are available on the I/O bus for USER/
	Channel fault indication to the channel, there is no way to way
	to indicate simultaneous faults. Accordingly, the cause indi-
	cated to the channel in case of simultaneous faults will be
	that which is closest to the top in the above list (in other
	words, the causes have been ranked according to the probability
	that they could "snowball" into other faults).

4.5.2.2	Channel Status

	"Channel" status is defined to be those fault conditions which are
	detected by the channel and which are recorded in the channel
	status word, independent of a possible simultaneous indication
	from the central.

4.5.2.2	Channel Status (continued)

	As in the case of central-detected faults, the channel-detected
	faults are ranked such that the case closest to the top is the
	only one reported in case of simultaneous faults.

4.5.3	Fault Definitions

	For the sake of convenience, the definitions of certain system fault
	conditions are provided below. If the condition is not listed
	here, it is assumed to be self-explanatory.

	Illegal channel number:  Detected if an instruction is issued to a
	                         channel whose number is greater than or
	                         equal to 40(8). No "holes" in the channel
	                         number assignments will be detected.

	256K overflow:           Detected when the address field of a
	                         control word (SCW, LPW, or DCW), when up-
	                         dated, will be equal to or greater than
	                         256K, but the tally will not decrement
	                         to zero. In the case of the LPW, LPWA
	                         bit 21 must equal zero to detect this
	                         fault.

	Character position field all one's, data service: When a USER/
	                         Channel fault is detected during a list
	                         service, the character position field of
	                         the DCW is purposely set to all one's.

	                         In the event that the channel fails to
	                         respond to the fault indication, it would
	                         try to use the DCW during a data service;
	                         the resulting system fault can be assumed
	                         to indicate the malfunction of the channel.

	Character position/size discrepancy, data service: This condi-
	                         tion is encountered if the character size
	                         field specified by the channel in the
	                         request for data service is inconsistent
	                         with the character position field in the
	                         DCW. For example, the channel may say it
	                         is a 9 bit channel; any character posi-
	                         tion count greater than 011(2) is invalid
	                         and the assumption is made that the most
	                         probable cause is a failure in the cen-
	                         tral's character position updating logic.
	                         Note that this same discrepancy is a
	                         USER/Channel fault if detected during a
	                         List service. Note also that this fault
	                         automatically becomes a "Character position

	                         be checked for a 9 bit channel.

	No core response:        The central begins a time-out upon issu-

	                         equal to zero.

	LPW tally runout:        Detected when the tally of the LPW
	                         is zero when the LPW is accessed, pro-
	                         vided that LPW 21 is zero and LPW 22 is one-

	Character position/
	size discrepancy, list
	service:                 This condition is encountered if the
	                         character size field specified by the
	                         channel is inconsistent with the
	                         character position field in the DCW.
	                         This is only checked for 9 bit channels.

	                         NOTE: This is a user fault, whereas
	                               all of the-faults_defined above
	                               are system faults.

1.3	Transient Error Rates

	A transient error is defined as a momentary error. It may or may,
	not be repeated in the sense that it can be made to recur but is is
	not a hard or continuous error as might be caused by a hard compo-
	nent, wire run, etc. failure.

	It is desirable that main frame system modules have an error rate
	sufficiently low to insure that their contribution to over-all sys-
	tem error rates is insignificant. Currently, mass storage media
	state-of-the-art non-recoverable read error rates are in the order
	of 10^-12 bits transferred. This would imply that the main frame
	equipment should have a transient error rate on the order of 10^-13
	bits. Since magnetics modules-in main frame equipment are the
	biggest contributors to error rates it is than desirable for the
	non-magnetic main frame equipment to have a transient error rates
	it is than desirable for the non-magnetic main frame equipment to
	have a transient error rate in the order of 10^-14 bits.

	Error rates on the order of 10^-13 or 10^-14 are virtually impossible
	to measure directly. Therefore, in order to determine whether or
	not the error rate is attainable, it is necessary to establish a
	criteria other than direct measurement.

	Typical causes of transient errors might be "flaky" gates, self
	generated noise from pulses and logic level changes generated
	within the equipment or externally generated noise. Of the three
	mentioned, self generated noise is the one which might be considered
	the most inherent cause of transient errors.

	Therefore, the criteria for measuring transient error rates shall
	be the signal to noise ratio as seen on the internal cabinet wiring.
	The mean signal to noise ratio should be 8.75 or greater for non-
	magnetic modules and 8.5 or greater for magnetic modules at a 90%
	confidence level. No sampled ratio shall be less than 8.0. Signal
	to noise ratio as used here is the voltage threshold level for going
	from a "0" to a "1" divided by the RMS value of the noise voltage.
	These signal to noise ratios give approximately 10^-17 and 10^-15 bit
	error probabilities on a single line of non-magnetic and magnetic
	modules respectively. These translate to 10^-14 and 10^-13 respectively
	by making the assumption.that there are 1,000 statistically indepen-
	dent (conservative assumption because they are probably not indepen-
	dent) lines in a cabinet that can contribute to transient errors as
	a result of noise.

	Measurement of Transient Error Rate

	This paragraph does not define explicitly how the transient error rate
	or signal to noise ratio should be measured, but it does point out
	some of the things that need to be considered in making this measurement.

6.1.3	Measurement of Transient Error Rate (cont.)

	The selection of points in a cabinet to be measured should take into
	account which signals are critical in the sense that false momen-
	tary triggering will cause an error. In addition, the location and/
	or bunching of such signals should be considered. That is to say,
	sample points should be selected from both densely and sparsely popu-
	lated areas.

	In determining the size of the s ample to be taken, it should be
	acceptable to assume that the standard deviation of the sample and
	the entire population are equal and that the distribution of the
	means of all possible samples is normal.  This then implies the
	following:

 
	     n
            ---     (S/N)
            \            i
            /
            ---
            i=1                 + 1.28 Os
            -----------------     -----------  <= (S/N) spec
                    n               -------
                                  \/   n

	     where: (S/N)  = Signal to noise ratio of the ith sample
                         i
 
                         n = Sample size -- greater than 30

                        Os = Standard deviation o fhte sample 1/2

                                /                                    2 \
                               |   n          2         /  n        \  |
                               |  ---  (S/N)         1  | ---       |  |
                               |  \         i      -n   | \   (S/N) |  |
                        Os =   |  /                     | /        i|  |
                               |  ---                   | ---       |  |
                               |  i=i                   \ n=1       /  |
                               |  -------------------------------      |
                               \                n - 1                 /

                    (S/N) spec = specified signal to noise ratio

	Averaging of signal to noise ratios in this manner to gain some
	assurance of a cabinets transient error rate is not theoretically
	sound unless the spread on the ratio is small.  For this reason
	the minimum value of 8.0 has been selected.

                   IOM CENTRAL BUS-INTERFACE

A.1	SCOPE

	This Appendix describes the performance requirements for the IOM
	Central/Channel Interface.

A.2	IOM CENTRAL BUS INTERFACE

	The IOM Central/Channel interface is implemented as a common, time-
	shared bus. All signals on the bus are in complement form. The I/O
	bus is organized as follows:

	o  The 37-bit (36 information plus parity) "D" bus carries service
	   requests, address extension and data from the channel to the
	   central.

	o  The 37-bit (36 information plus parity) "U" bus carries data,
	   address extension and control words from the central to all
	   channels.

	o  The 11-bit "C" bus provides control flags and strobes from the
	   Central to all channels. It also carries the common Channel Re-
	   quests for Service (CRS) line from the channels to the central.

	o  The 6-bit "P" bus carries the five serial priority lines from
	   channel to channel, plus Group Activity Inhibit (GAI).

	o  The 6-bit "N" bus provides the channel number which accompanies
	   a peripheral control word.

A.2.1	D BUS: INPUT DATA BUS

	When a channel requests service it must specify the type of service
	by placing certain information on the data input bus. The formats
	required for the specific services are given below:

	o  Program Interrupt Cell Field - A three-bit field used in conjunction
	   with the IOM Identity switches to select one of 32 program inter-
	   rupt words and the associated interrupt cell in the System Controller.
	   Valid only during Program Interrupt Service (PI). Bits 16 and 17
	   must be zero.

	o  Channel Number Field - A six-bit field used to specify the number
	   assigned to the requesting channel. This number is used to deter-
	   mined "mailbox" addresses and to identify the channel being ser-
	   viced when a system fault occurs. During a Program Interrupt Ser-
	   vice, the five least-significant bits of this field select the bit
	   in the IMW to be set.

	o  Service Request Field - A three-bit field used to describe the type
	   of service the Central is to perform. The invalid code will cause
	   a system fault. The bits are coded as follows:

	SRO     SR1     SR2
	(27)    (28)    (29)
        --------------------

	 0       0       0      INV - Invalid
	 0       0       1      LST - List Service
	 0       1       0      STA - Status Service
	 0       1       1      PI - Program Interrupt Service
	 1       0       0      ILD - Indirect Data Load Service
	 1       0       1      IST --Indirect Data Store Service
	 1       1       0      DLD - Direct Data Load Service
	 1       1       1      DST - Direct Data Store Service

A.2.1	D BUS: INPUT DATA BUS  (cont.)



	o  Character Position & "READ" Field - The character position resi-
	   due is to be ORed into the character position field of the DCW
	   residue status word (the odd word of status pair); the "READ"
	   bit is placed in bit 21 of the DCW residue status word. The
	   generation of these bits is the responsibility of the channel,
	   and they are only valid during a status service.

	o  Address extension (0-2) and (3-5) - These two fields specify
	   the 6-bit address extension to be used by the central in
	   forming 24 bit addresses.

	o  Direct Data Address Field for a service request of DLD or DST,
	   the address field together with the address extension fields
	   specify an absolute address to be used on the direct load or
	   direct store cycle. This field is ignored for a service request
	   of ILD or IST.

	o  Mod Field - This 1-bit field is valid only for a service re-
	   quest of LST and DLD.

	   A "1" in the Mod field for LST indicates that this is a "first list
	   service" and that the central must obtain the LPW and LPW
	   extension from core rather than from the scratchpad. A "1" in the
	   Mod field for DLD indicates that the service requested is a DirectRD C1ear

	o  DP Double Precision Field - A one-bit in this field indicates
	   that the service requested is to be double precision. Valid
	   only with ILD, IST, DLD, or DST.

	o  Character (Byte) Size Field - A one-bit field generated by the
	   channel which describes the character size (CS) used in an
	   indirect DATA Service. The CS bits are coded as follows:

	   This bit equal to "0" indicates a CS of 9 bits or equal to "1"
	   indicates a CS of 36 bits.

	   NOTE: The CS bits must be provided during a list service as
	         well as during DATA services.  Data transfers of 72
	         bits are accomplished by a double precision transfer
	         of two 36-bit words.

A.2.1	D BUS: INPUT DATA BUS  (cont.)

A.2.2	Data Formats

	There are two possible data formats on the "D" bus. The data for-
	mats on the "D" bus are as follows:

	0                 36-Bit Word/Byte Format                  35
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	|                       DATA                                |P|
	---------------------------------------------------------------

	0                  9-Bit Byte Format                       35
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	|      Zero                             26,|27    Data      |P|
	---------------------------------------------------------------


A.2.2	U BUS:  OUTPUT DATA BUS

	Information from the central to the channel appears on the U bus
	in one of three separate formats:

	(1)  PCW information - The PCW obtained as a result of a connect
	     operation is sent to the channel on the U bus. The informa-
	     tion is not reformatted by the channel, but is placed on the
	     U-bus exactly as it was obtained from the store.


	(2)  DCW information - A DCW obtained during a list service is
	     placed on the U bus so that the channel may extract address
	     extension character position and action code information.

	(3)  Data - Data intended for a channel is placed on the U bus,
	     right justified (i.e., a 9-bit character will be placed on
	     U 27-35).

A.2.3	C BUS:  CONTROL BUS

	The 11-bit C bus is defined as follows:

	o  Channel Initialize - Upon receipt of this signal all channels
	   are required to go to a masked condition. CIN will appear as
	   a negative level for more than 1 microsecond.

	o  Scan Double and Data --These signals govern the interaction
	   between the channels and the central

	o  Channel request for Service - A channel initiates service by
	   placing this line to the "0" state (see paragraph 4.3).

                                                      ----------------------

A.2.3	C BUS: CONTROL BUS  (cont.)

	o  TLO, TL1 - (Tally Indicators) - These two bits indicate the
	   contents of the tally field for three general conditions:

	   a) Indirect Data Service: DCW tally after updating.

	   b) List Service, except Connect Channel: DCW tally as it
	      will be placed in the mailbox.

	   c) List Service, Connect Channel: These flags are not appli-
	      cable during service to the connect channel.

	   The bits are coded as follows:

	       TLO     TL1     Tally value
               ---     ---     -----------

	        0       0      Zero-or greater than three
	        0       1      One
	        1       0      Two
	        1       1      Three


	o  System Fault - The central will place a "0" on this line to
	   indicate that it has detected a System Fault. A channel is
	   required to go into a masked state upon receiving a System
	   Fault indication.

	o  User Fault - These three lines are encoded to provide the chan-
	   nel with User Fault information whenever the central has de-
	   tected a User Fault (see paragraph 4.4.2).

                US0     US1    US2    Fault
                ---     ---    ---    -----
	         0       0      0     No User Fault
	         0       0      1     LPW Tally runout (not connect channel)
	         0       1      0     2 TDCW's in succession
	         0       1      1     Boundary Errors
	         1       0      0     Address_control change in restricted mode
	         1       0      1     IDCW in restricted mode
	         1       1      0     Channel Size discrepancy
	         1       1      1     Parity error on Data bus

A.2.4	E BUS:  CHANNEL NUMBER BUS

	This 6-bit bus indicates the channel which is to respond to a
	Peripheral Control Word (PCW). The channel number will be provided
	only in conjunction with a connect service (i.e., it will not be
	"wrapped back around" to a channel during data, list, status, etc.)

                      IOM -B PAGING MECHANISM
B1.	INTRODUCTION

	The IOM-B paging mechanism will provide the IOM-B with the
	capability to access store using a series of references to 1024
	word pages which may be located in random areas throughout
	store. These reference words are contained in a Page Table
	which must be set up by the operating software prior to acti-
	vating a channel for an I/O operation. The absolute location
	(MOD 64) of the channels Page Table (Page Table Pointer) is
	given to the IOM in the second word of the PCW used to activate
	the channel and is stored in a scratchpad on a channel basis.
	The Page Table Words contained in the Page Table are accessed
	when required and stored in the scratchpad on a channel basis.
	Scratchpad area for two Page Table Words must be provided
	for each channel - one for the DCW List (PTW-LPW) and one
	for the data (PTW-DCW). Generally both will be obtained from
	the same Page Table. The contents of the Page Table Words
	are used to determine the absolute locations of data or DCW's.
	Paging is requested on an individual channel basis through
	control bits in the PCW and program TDCW control bits.

	In order to decrease the effect of the paging mechanism on IOM
	performance and to provide a storage area for the new control
	words, it is mandatory that all configured channels be provided
	with scratchpad storage space. The scratchpads will therefore
	be designed such that one standard scratchpad will be capable
	of storing all information for channels 8 through 39 and an
	identical scratchpad may be optionally added to store all
	information for channels 40 through 63. If some control words
	must be stored on boards other than the IOM "scratchpad"
	boards, storage for channels 8 through 63 must be provided.
	Any attempt to run a channel which does not have scratchpad
	space will result in a system fault "Illegal Channel Number"
	(01).

	The IOM-B will be capable of operating in any of three modes
	(as selected on the Mode SELECT switch): (1) Standard GCOS
	(2) Extended GCOS (3) Paged. When the Mode SELECT switch
	is in the Paged position all base and bounds information will be
	interpreted as described in paragraph B4(B) for "Page" mode.
	Paging will be performed for individual channels if specified
	in the PCW as described later, otherwise channels will operate
	as in "Extended GCOS," not relative mode. Changes may be
	made in the implementation of the Standard GCOS and Extended
	GCOS modes to facilitate paged mode implementation but these
	should not affect existing operating systems.

	PAGE CONTROL WORDS
	------------------

	A.  Page Table Pointer

	    The Page Table Pointer is sent to the IOM-B as part of PCW
	    Word 2 during a connect operation and will be stored in a
	    channel scratchpad.

	     ---------------------------------------------------------------

	    Parity will be generated and stored for the Page Table Pointer.

	    The Page Table Pointer is used to assist in determining the
	    location of the Page Table Word in the Page Table as follows:

	    Bits 45 - 62 - An 18 bit address, mod 64, which points to the
	    beginning of the payload channels page table.

	    Bit 63 - The PTP flag (PCW-63) must be Set if PTW fetch is
	    desired. Any attempt to perform a PTW fetch when PCW-63
	    is reset will result in a System Fault (14).

	    Bit 64 - Control of the paging operation is provided on a
	    channel basis by the PGE flag (PCW-64) and through the
	    channels LPW and TDCW.

	    Bit 65 - If an auxiliary Page Table Word is required, the
	    operating system must set bit 65 (AUX) of the PCW to indi-
	    cate that the IOM is to obtain an auxiliary PTW from the
	    channel's mailbox address for the DCW as follows:

	ADDR 0     5 6               16 17 18        21 22  23
             ---------------------------------------------------
             |      |    IOM Base   |  |  |            |   |   |

             |      |    Address    |  |  |            |   |   |
             ------------------------------            |   |   |
                               |  |  |                 |   |   |
                               ---------------------------------
                               |  |  |     Channel     |   |   |

                               ---------------------------------

	The auxiliary PTW, via PCW65, may be used to access the DCW
	list when the IOM is in sub mode 3B or 4 (see paragraph B4(D)).
	Any TDCW encountered while the IOM is in sub-mode 4 will cause
	the DCW list to be immediately referenced to the normal page
	table and the IOM to enter sub-mode 5. IDCW's are not allowed
	in the DCW list stored in the page referenced by the auxiliary
	PTW. Format for the auxiliary PTW is identical to that for
	the standard PTW shown in paragraph B2(B). LPW 23 is also
	not allowed in the original LPW setup by the software if retrys
	are expected since hardware will have no means of returning to
	the auxiliary PTW under this condition.

	1.  Data Service

	    The method by which an address is generated to access a
	    page table word for data services depends upon whether
	    the service requested is direct or indirect type.

	    (a) Direct Data Service PTW addressing is performed
	         using the PTP as follows:

	ADDR 0     5 6               16 17 18        23 
             -------------------------------------------
             |Page Table | M| M|    |  |  |            | Beginning of
             |Pointer    | B| B|  ------->|            | Page Table
             |           | Z| Z|    |  |  |            |
             ------------------------------            |
                                      or               |
                         -------------------------------
                         |  |  |  Direct Channel       | Page Number or
                         |<----------       ---------->| Page Table
                         |  |  |   ADDR 06~13          |    Offset
                         -------------------------------

	    where a logical "OR" is allowed on the PTP bits 16,
	    17 and Direct Channel Address 6,7. For the standard
	    direct channel 256 word page table the page table
	    pointer must be assigned a mod 256 location by soft-
	    ware (these bits will not be checked by hardware and
	    unexpected results will be obtained if this rule is not
	    followed).

	    (b) Indirect Data Service PTW addressing is performed
	        as follows:
     
	        -----------------------                  Beginning of
                |  Page Table         |                   IOM Page
                | Pointer 00~17       |                     Table
                -----------------------

	                        plus

	        --------------------------------------- Page Number or
                |             | S | D | D |   DCW     | Page Table
	        |  Zeros      | E | C | C |   2~7     |   Offset
                |             | G | 0 | 1 |           |
	        ---------------------------------------
  	    ADDR 0             15  16  17  18        23
 



                                                         43A239854    
                                                      ----------------------

Honeywell   Rev. D                                                 Page B6

	        where SEG, and DCW 00 and DCW 01 are added
	        to the contents of PTP 00-17 in order to generate
	        ADDR 00 17. (The meaning of SEG will be
	        explained later.)

	2.  List Service

	    The location of the page table words to be used in accessing
	    a DCW list varies by optionally setting PCW 65 (AUX).
	    When PCW 65:1 the PTW for the DCW list will initially
	    be obtained from the DCW core mailbox as described
	    earlier in this appendix. This auxiliary PTW will be used
	    to access the DCW list until a TDCW is encountered after
	    the LPW has gone Relative, at which time the PTW's for
	    the DCW list (PTW-LPW) are obtained from the channel's
	    page table as described below.

	    The normal list PTW (either PCW 65=0 or after TDCW
	    described above) addressing is accomplished as follows:

	    -----------------------                  Beginning of
            |  Page Table         |                   Page Table
            |     Pointer 00~17   |
            -----------------------

	    --------------------------------------- Page Number or
            |             | S | L | L |   LPW     | Page Table
	    |  Zeros      | E | P | P |   2~7     |   Offset
            |             | G | W | W |           |
            |             |   | 0 | 1 |           |
	    ---------------------------------------
	ADDR 0             15  16  17  18        23
 
	    where SEG, LPW 00 and LPW 01 are added to the contents
	    of PTP O0~17 (the meaning of SEG will be explained later).

	    The Page Table Word will be accessed using a Read
	    Restore Single Precision instruction code. Parity will
	    be generated and stored for each Page Table Word.

	B.  Page Table Word

	    The Page Table Word obtained as described in the previous para-
	    graph will be stored in the channel scratchpad and the Page Present

	    a Page Table which is located by LPW 0-7, DCW 0-7 or

 	C.  Page Control Flags    
	    It will be necessary to provide some internal indicators
	    for control of the paging mechanism in the NSA IOM. These
	    indicators will be stored on a channel basis (channels 10(8)
	    through 77(8)).

	    PTP FLG

	    The PTP-FLG will be interrogated by the NSA-IOM to verify
	    that a valid Page Table is available for the channel. The PTP
	    FLG may be set only by receipt of a PCW for the channel with
	    bit 63 set. It may be reset by

	    a)   Receipt of a PCW for the channel with bit 63 reset

	    or

	    b)  A terminate interrupt service by the channel with the
	        character size bit of the transaction command = 1
	        (Transaction Command bit 32). At present only the
	        Direct Channel will not perform this type of service.

	    PTW-FLG

	    The PTW-FLG will be interrogated by the NSA-IOM to deter-
	    mine when a new PTW is required for the service in progress.
	    There will be two PTW-FLG's required, one for the DCW and
	    one for the data. Either PTW-FLG may be set only by
	    receipt of a PTW for the channel with the Page Present Flag
	    set (PTW bit 33). Reset depends upon whether it is the
	    PTW-FLG for the DCW (PTW-LPW) or for the data (PTW-DCW).

	        DCW (PTW-LPW)

	        A new PTW-LPW will be required when the IOM is in
	        a "paging" submode and:

	        a)  A first list is performed

	        or

	        b)  A TDCW is encountered and the current PTW is not
	            the auxiliary PTW or the TDCW causes the IOM to
	            enter submode 5 and the current PTW is the auxiliary
	            PTW.

	        or

	        c)  A 1K page overflow is detected in the LPW address
	            field and the current PTW is not the auxiliary PTW.

	        or

	        d)  A Backup List Service is requested

	        Data (PTW -DCW)

	        The PTW-FLG will be reset to indicate a requirement
	        for a new PTW-DCW when:

	        a)  Any List Service is performed

	        or

	        b)  A 1K page overflow is detected in the DCW address
	            field.

	    D.  Parity Checks

	        The IOM will maintain parity integrity on the PTP and PTW's.
	        Any parity errors detected on these words will result in a system
	        fault "Scratchpad Parity Error."

B3.	DEFINITIONS

	The following is the definition of some words which will be used later
	in the description of the NSA IOM. They are concerned primarily
	with the various means of address generation when the IOM is in the
	"Paged" mode.

	SEG Additional address bit used to indicate when the second half
	  of a 512 word page table is to be accessed. It is obtained as a
	  result of the TDCW SEG bit or by the addition of the Lower Bound
	  plus DCW Address when data is segmented.

	REAL = All addresses are referenced from location  and are not
	  modified by the page table words.

	PAGED = All addresses are referenced to the beginning of the page
	  table.



                                                         43A239854    
                                                      ----------------------

Honeywell   Rev. D                                                 Page B13

	SEGMENTED = Data is referenced to the Lower Bound and the
	    page table. If the DCW's are paged, subsequent TDCW's
	    will be referenced to the Lower Bound also.

	EXTENDED = All addresses are referenced from location 0 of a
	    256K block selected by the PCW/IDCW 12-17 and are not
	    modified by the Page Table Words.

	RELATIVE = Data is referenced to the Lower Bound and not the
	    page table. The base will be biased to the 256K block
	    selected by the PCW/IDCW 12-17. This "submode" is not
	    allowed if the IOM switch is in the "Paged" mode. LPW
	    bit 23 will be ignored by hardware in this case, forcing
	    operation in the "Extended" submode.

B4.	BASIC IOM CONTROL WORD FORMATS

	Definition of the basic IOM control words is only slightly affected by
	the logic necessary for the paging mechanism but an 18 bit base, 18
	bit size capability will greatly affect the LPWX. Formats for the
	various control words are shown below and differences noted.

	During backup list services (automatic retrys) LPW bit 20 will be
	controlled by an IOM internal flag which will track the state of the
	LPW bit 20 whenever an IDCW is pulled or a first list performed.

	    Bit 23  If the IOM is paged and PCW bit 64 is off, LPW
	       bit 23 is ignored by hardware. If bit 64 is set, LPW
	       bit 23 causes the data to become segmented.

	Word 2. There is a significant difference between the format of this
	word in the two GCOS modes and its format in the Paged position.
	Not only is the Lower Bound and Size now 18 bits but the Lower Bound
	is MOD2 and the size MOD1.  This increase in the Lower Bound
	allows a users area to be a 256K word window in a 512K word working
	space when the REL (LPW bit 23) bit is set and PCW bit 63 and 64=1.

	In order to provide the "Backup" list address, a scratchpad for
	storage of the LPW address used during first lists or any IDCW access
	must be provided for the maximum of 63 channels. This scratchpad
	will therefore be used for the "Backup" list address source in all
	IOM modes.

	Page Mode Boundary Checking

	Notation -

	The following notation will be used to define boundary checking and
	addressing conversion for paged mode. EXT GCOS and STD GCOS
	Mode Boundary Checking is described in paragraph 3.3.

	A = initial DCW address MOD 01

	A_R = initial DCW address (relative to Lower Bound). MOD 01

	S = the number of words addressable by the program starting
	    from the Lower Bound. MOD 01

	T = initial DCW tally. MOD O1

	     is forced to a "0" by hardware if LPW bit 23 is set. This will

	The TDCW for paging operation contains three new control bits.

	PDCW (Page DCW) - This bit controls whether the LPW address is
	Real or whether it must reference the Page Table for its absolute
	store location (a one requires paging). This bit will be stored in
	LPW bit 20 for subsequent use. Any attempt to set this flag after the
	I/O has gone restricted will cause a User Fault (O4) to be stored by
	the channel.

	PDTA (Page Data) - This bit controls the operation of the IOM during
	data services when neither the PDCW or REL bits are set. It will
	determine whether the DCW address is Real or whether it must
	reference the Page Table for its absolute store location (a one
	requires paging). This bit will be stored on a channel basis in the
	IOM and will be reset when a connect is received for the channel.
	The state of this bit is overridden if the PDCW or REL bit is set or
	if LPW bit 20 or LPW bit 23 is set (it will be ignored by the hardware).
	It is illegal to set this bit with a TDCW in the middle of a list of
	DCW's without including an intervening IDCW either immediately
	preceding or following the TDCW.

	SEG - This bit furnishes the 19th address bit (MSD) of a TDCW address
	used for locating the DCW list in a 512 word page table. It will have
	meaning only in the TDCW where:

	   (a)   the DCW list is already paged and the TDCW calls for the
	         DCW segmented

	or
	   (b)   the data is already segmented and the TDCW calls for the
	         DCW list to be paged

	or
	   (c)   neither data is segmented nor DCW list is paged and the
	         TDCW calls for both.

	    The format for these DCW' s will remain unchanged from that
	    described in paragraph 3. 2. 3. 3. DCW addresses for channels
	    1-7 will be treated as absolute addresses. Segmented DCW's
	    will have 18 bit base added to their address in Paged Mode and
	    9 bit base added to their relative address in GCOS or EXT GCOS
	    Mode as described in paragraph B4(B) and 3. 3.

	F.  Status Control Word

	    The SCW format remains as described in paragraph 3. 2. 4. All
	    SCW addresses will be treated as absolute referenced to store.

	G.  Channel and Device Status Words

	    The Status Word format remains the same as described in paragraph
	    3. 2. 5. All DCW residues stored in the status in page mode will
	    represent the next absolute address (bits 6-23) of data prior to
	    application of the Page Table Word.

	H.  Interrupt Multiplex Word

	    The addition of the ability to react to channels 40(8) through 77(8)
	    has made the use of additional interrupt levels (and IMW words)
	    necessary to accommodate these new channels. Due to the
	    implementation within the channels, only PSIA and Direct
	    Channels may be assigned channel numbers greater than 37(8).

	Some of interrupt cells to which the NEW IMW LOCATIONS are being
	assigned may have dual assignments.

B5.	THEORY OF OPERATION - INDIRECT CHANNEL (Except Channels 0 to 7)

	The IOM-B paging operation will be enabled only after a connect has
	been sent to the IOM channel with PCW WD2 bits 63 and 64 = 1, and the
	mode switch is in the page position. Typical operation using present
	operating software I/O routines for a PSIA disk channel is shown in
	Figure B1, description of which follows.

	The PCW received for the channel contains a Page Table Pointer which
	is used as an absolute address pointing to the beginning of the Page Table
	unique to this I/O. The payload channel will react to the PCW directed
	to it by performing a First List service when requested by the disk
	controller to do so. The LPW and LPWX obtained during this service
	will be stored in the scratchpad and the PTW-DCW flag will be reset.

	In the example, initially the LPW will be real so that the DCW list will
	be accessed by using the absolute address contained in the LPW. The
	first IDCW will be accessed in this manner and sent to the disk
	controller as a Seek Command.

	The disk controller will respond to the seek command with a request
	which will cause the PSIA to perform a List Service followed by a
	single precision, indirect data load service. The DCW list will again
	be accessed using the absolute address contained in the LPW. The
	next DCW accessed will be a TDCW which will set the IOM to the
	"Paged Data" mode. The DCW subsequently obtained due to the TDCW
	will be stored in the scratchpad and pulled during the indirect data
	load service. The IOM paging mechanism has been set to the "Paged
	Data" mode by the first TDCW so all data services for payload
	channels will require paging to be applied, thus the IOM will pull a
	Page Table Word (PTW-DCW 1) using DCW bits 0-7 as an offset
	above the location specified by the Page Table Pointer (page number).

	This will point to a 1024 word page somewhere in the programs SSA
	which will contain the Seek Address data. DCW bits 8-17 will select
	the particular location in that page which contains the required data.
	This data will then be sent to the disk controller.

	The disk controller will ultimately request the PSIA to obtain a new
	IDCW from the DCW list. The word will again be accessed using the
	absolute address contained in the LPW and sent to the disk controller.
	In the example the IDCW contains a Read Command.

	The disk controller will respond to the Read IDCW with a request which
	will cause the IOM to perform a list service and access the next
	sequential location above the Read IDCW . This location contains a
	TDCW which changes the LPW to indicate segmented data, and DCW
	paged and points to the users DCW list. (The SEG bit could also apply
	here.) In order to determine the proper page to which the TDCW
	points, a PTW-LPW must be pulled from store using TDCW 0-7 (and
	SEG if applicable) as an offset above the location specified by the Page
	Table Pointer. TDCW 8-17 will select the particular location in the
	page which contains the new DCW. This new PTW-LPW-1 and. DCW
	will be stored in the scratchpad. The data address will have had the
	Lower Bound added to it and also have been checked for boundary
	faults prior to storing in the scratchpad. The PTW-DCW flag will be
	reset.

	The PSIA will begin performing Store Data Services upon completion
	of the above list services. The first data service will cause the IOM
	to pull a Page Table Word (PTW-DCW 2) to apply to the new
	segmented data. This PTW is located by using the new DCW 0-7 to
	determine offset from the Page Table Pointer. The remaining DCW
	bits 8-17 are used to determine the location within the page where
	data is to be stored. Data services will continue using this PTW
	until either

	    (a)    The data address is incremented to cause overflow into
	           DCW_7 (overflow into next page) or

	    (b)    A new list service is performed.

	There is not sufficient spare hardware to allow comparison of past
	and present DCW's for similarity of PTW's, therefore, every list
	service will cause the channel to require a new PTW on the next
	data service.

	When either of the above occurs the IOM will obtain a new PTW via
	methods previously explained. The PTW will be tested for validity
	by checking the Page Present Flag (bit 33). If this bit is pulled as
	a zero, a system fault (15) will be reported on behalf of the payload
	channel and the channel will go masked. If the PTW flag is a "1",
	data transfer will proceed as described above using the new PTW. A
	Terminate Interrupt request by the channel which has bit 32 of the
	transaction command field set will result in the PTP flag being reset
	by the hardware. Any further attempt by the channel to perform data
	services will result in a system fault (14).

B6.	THEORY OF OPERATION - DIRECT CHANNEL

	The IOM-B paging operations will be enabled only as described in
	paragraph B5. Typical operation using proposed operation software
	I/O routines for the DDC direct channel is shown in Figure B2.

	The PCW received for the channel contains a Page Table Pointer
	which is used as an absolute address pointing to the Page Table which
	has been set up by software for the Direct Channel. All addresses
	for the Direct Channel will be accessed using this Page Table if paging
	has been requested in the PCW.

	The Direct Channel will cause the IOM to pull a new PTW from store by
	making a Direct Load or Store Command with the character size bit
	(bit 32) set in the transaction command. The IOM will check the Page
	Present, Write Control and Housekeeping bits for validity after
	storing the new PTW and will cause a System Fault (15) if the test
	fails. The IOM will also check the PTP flag for a "1" and will cause
	a System Fault (14) if it is reset. It is suggested that software send
	a masked PCW with the bit 63 reset to all channel numbers during
	the startup period to guarantee that no channel will cause unexpected
	transfers. The IOM hardware will not automatically reset the PTP

	channel will not have this capability, therefore, the PTP flag may be
	reset only by a new PCW with bit 63:0.

B7.	MAINTAINABILITY AND TROUBLESHOOTING AIDS

	In order to provide a means of verifying the contents of the various
	Page Table control words, certain changes must be made to the IOM
	logic.

	a)  The IOM will generate and store good parity for the PTP, PTW,
	    and Backup list data. The Backup list data and PTW-LPW will
	    be tested for good parity each time they are pulled.

	b)  The PTP and PTW used for data access (PTW-DCW) and the PTP
	    and PTW-DCW flags will be enabled to the parity checking network
	    as data lower when the DCW is accessed from the scratchpad for
	    data services during paging operation.

	c)  The scratchpad access channel will be changed so that the new
	    associative memory may be read using the addresses described
	    on page 61 for the SCW. Data must have previously been stored
	    using normal methods. That is, PTP during a connect, PTW's
	    during a list and during a data service, Backup list address during
	    a first list or a list which results in an IDCW being accessed.

B8.	NSA-IOM FAULT. CODE DEFINITIONS

	The following definitions apply only to those faults which are unique
	to the NSA-IOM operation. Those which are not discussed here
	remain as described in paragraph 4. 5. 1 and 4. 5. 3.

	A.  System Faults

	    Illegal Channel number: Requesting channel number does not
	    (01)      have a scratchpad installed in the IOM.

	    Parity Error Scratchpad: (a) Hardware has detected a failure of
            (03)      the PTP or PTW scratchpad to properly store incoming
	              data. (b) Parity error is detected on the read data for
	              either PTP, PTW or control words when accessing
	              scratchpad.

	    256K OFL: (a) For a non-paged channel the definition remains
	    (10)      as described in paragraph 4. 5. 1. (b) For a paged
	              channel, the definition remains the same as in
	              paragraph 4. 5. 1 except if data is segmented. In
	              this case the 256K OFL fault will occur under the
	              described conditions of paragraph 4. 5. 1 if the SEG
	              bit of the address is set (512K OFL) for DCW
	              addresses or LPW addresses if the DCW list is
	              segmented.

	    Illegal Tally control: The definition remains as described in
	    (13)      paragraph 4. 5. 1 except that this fault is forced by the
	              hardware if the free-edge to free-edge connection between
	              NSAIG and NSAIE board is not installed properly.

	    PTP-Fault: The internally stored PTP-Flag for the requesting
	    (14)      channel was zero or the free -edge to free-edge cable
	              from NSAIC to NSBIM was not installed properly when
	              the channel request required a PTW fetch to be
	              performed or an overflow has occurred in the PTP
	              address adder.

                                                      ----------------------

Honeywell   Rev. D                                                 Page B36

	    PTW-Flag-Fault: Any of three conditions present in the PTW
	    (15)      fetched for the channel could cause this fault to occur:
	              (a) the Page Present Flag (PTW bit 33) is reset
	              (b) the channel data is segmented (LPW bit 23 = 1),
	                  an indirect store service is required, and the
	                  Write Control Bit (PTW bit 31) is reset, or the
	                  Housekeeping bit (PTW bit 32) is set.
	              (c) the channel requests a Direct Store service and
	                  either the Write Control Bit (PTW bit 31) is reset
	                  or the Housekeeping bit (PTW bit 32) is set.

	B.  Central Detected Status

	    Boundary violation: Boundary error occurred when performing
	    (03)      boundary check on the DCW fetched during a list
	             service with the data or DCW list being referenced to
	             the Page Table (LPW 20 or 23 = 1) or Page Data set).
