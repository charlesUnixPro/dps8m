\section{SCU}

From the Multicians' Multics Glossary:

\begin{quote}
SCU

[BSG] (1) System Control Unit, or Memory Controller. The multiported, 
arbitrating interface to each bank of memory (usually 128 or 256 KWords), each
port connecting to a port of an "active device" (CPU, GIOC or IOM, bulk store
or drum controller). On the 645, the clock occupied an SCU as well. The SCUs
have their own repertoire of opcodes and registers, including those by which
system interrupts are set by one active unit for another. (See connect.) The
flexibility of this architecture was significant among the reasons why the GE
600 line was chosen for Multics. See SCAS.

SCAS

[BSG] (for "System Controller Addressing Segment") A supervisor segment with
one page in the memory space described by each SCU (or other passive module) in
the system. The SCAS contains no data, is not demand-paged, and its page table
is not managed by page control. Instructions directed specifically to an SCU as
opposed to the memory it controls are issued to absolute addresses in the SCAS
through pointers (in the SCS) calculated during initialization precisely to
this end. Typical of such instructions are cioc (issue a connect), smic (set an
interrupt), and the instructions to read and set SCU registers (including
interrupt masks). On the 6180, rccl (the instruction to read the SCU-resident
calendar clock) did not require an absolute address, but a port number,
obviating the need for the SCAS to be visible outside ring 0 to support user
clock-reading as had been the case on the 645. The SCAS, which is a segment but
not a data base, is an example of exploiting the paging mechanism for a purpose
other than implementing virtual memory.

connect

[BSG] Communication signal sent from one active device to another. When
received by a processor, as polled for the control unit after each instruction
pair like an interrupt, a special fault (connect fault), very much like an
interrupt, is taken. As with interrupts, processors send "connects" to each
other through the SCU, the only possible channel. While an interrupt is set in
an SCU register and fielded by the first "taker" of all appropriately masked
CPUs, a connect fault is routed by the SCU to one, specified processor (or I/O
controller), and cannot be masked against (although the recipient's inhibit bit
can postpone it for a short while). Sending a connect to the GIOC or IOM was
the way of instructing it to begin executing I/O commands. See SCAS.

Multics uses connects for forcing all CPUs to take note of SDW and PTW invalidation (and clear their associative memories and execute a partial cache clear when appropriate), holding CPUs in the air during critical phases of dynamic reconfiguration, and the like. If my memory serves me well, functions such as system crashing, scheduler preemption, and processor startup switched back and forth between software-generated interrupts and connects throughout the '70s.
\end {quote}

The simulator currently abstracts away the SCUs.

\begin{itemize}

\item The clock is implemented as a seperate SIMH device.

\item The CPU connects directly to the IOMs.

\item Memory is implemented a a single, device independent model.

\item The SIMH CPU device only supports single CPUs currently, so the CPU to CPU communication issues are ignored for now. To get proper mult-CPU support, the SCU will probably need to be reallzed.
\end {itemize}

\section {IOM}

[cac] The reference document I have been using is 43A239854 ENGINEERING PRODUCT PECIFICATION, PART 1 6000B INPUT/OUT MULTIPLEXER (IOM) CENTRAL

The IOM model abstracts away controller devices such as the MPC. This means the
IOM code is very device aware, including extracting dev\_code values to enable
routing of connections. Unfortunately, this complexity leads to bugs relating
to the confusion of dev\_codes with SIMH UNIT numbers. Adding MPC devices would
isolate the complexities of dev\_code handling from the complexities of
connection handling, is probably a good idea.

\section {Tape}

The device seems good to go; it is a very abstract model, with no hardware modeling beyond a tracking a virtual cable to a port on an IOM.

\section {Disk}

Existing code base is skeletal.

The simulator has been provide with commands to 'cable' together the various subsystems. The current test configuration is:
